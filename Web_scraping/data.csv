"does ring want more money? - older devices malfunctioning so you can upgrade?","first i purchased the ring doorbell 2 like 4 months ago. it worked fine at first then it started having problems wouldn't capture motions quickly enuff. it would skip some motions. the image would get blurry. i contacted help/support and i really didn't like the process i had to go through to get a new device. which might have been refurbished at best. so i decided to upgrade to 3plus. now i cant use the subscription i paid for with doorbell 2. i need a new subscription and i lost my old recordings. i emailed and still haven't gotten a response from the company. what i did get is emails about this review. flimsy cover didn't like how it doesn't fit properly feels like i might break it someday when changing batteries. they are lying about 1080p - the image quality is like 240p. they say its 5ghz capable? its mostly connected to 2.4ghz at the router is like 7 feet away. pre roll not so great - doesn't work at night -low quality image - i guess its okay in the daytime, it does the job now and i can see whats going on. at night when my security lights go on the night vision deactivates and visibility is worse than ring doorbell 2. kinda disappointed i had to shell out this much money in the last few months for the service. 2 devices and 2 subscriptions 4 batteries. they keep emailing me to remove this review. im not going to remove it because its been a few weeks already and they haven’t responded to my initial email about paying for a new subscription. also the new app update sucks - they took away landscape mode and now it only works in portrait mode. i might return this before my return window closes and try the nest doorbell. update 05/15/2020 - they removed the 3 minute snapshot feature for battery owners. what are u guys nuts? running the company to the ground? now you must buy a solar panel charger or hardwire for 3 min snapshot feature. update 9-02-20 ring app has more bugs and problems then before. i have no idea why they tinker with it to be worse. update 11-07-22 they censor and delete comments of  the neighbors and give you the illusion that your voice counts; also I suspect they are mining your data and selling the data also....prob bots...

"Great features, but disappointed.","Upgraded from Doorbell 2. The pre-roll was a great feature and worked pretty well. However, I had to return it and put the Doorbell 2 back because the 3 Plus kept dropping WiFi randomly (hardwired and mesh WiFi router with in 5ft from the doorbell, tried both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz). Live view would rarely work because of it. I could only see the camera when a motion was detected or someone pressed the doorbell. My Doorbell 2 never had this problem. I think the doorbell would just put itself in sleep mode and disconnect from WiFi. But with “Live View” on, it should never disconnect from WiFi. I would love to keep the 3 Plus, but until they fix this issue. I’m gonna have to return it.","17 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Jill T.","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0"
"Fail","This is my first Ring product. I thought I was moving up from some other cameras I have around the house.  Not so sure about this. I'm very familiar with setting up security systems and wifi enabled devices.  I've had the motion range set to only my porch and it went off all night being set to medium sensitivity. I adjusted the camera to angle down more this morning and bumped the sensitivity up to Max since it's only facing the immediate area outside my door with easily 20ft with no trees,  bushes or movement beyond the motion zone.  So being happy that I think I solved the issue,  I'm currently upstairs working and my dog starts going nuts. I look out and the mail man is going back to his truck to get my second load of Amazon packages. He comes back again to my front door directly in front of my Ring cam. My $29 Wyze cam picked it up and went off. My generic $69 Chinese camera picked it up from the garage angle. My $229 Ring cam mounted directly in front of a mailman at my door twice failed.  No notification whatsoever. Everything is set correctly and if this happens one more time it's going back. UPDATE:  The next morning..All settings such as motion areas and sensitivity have somehow changed back to what they were on their own.  I changed my password just incase this thing is hacked. My wifi strength is good and I doubled checked ALL my settings early this morning and as of right now I'm sitting having breakfast and my phone buzzes from my other brand camera so I look out my window and see the mail truck ONCE AGAIN leaving my house and sure enough there's a package sitting right below this Ring Doorbell. No notification at all from Ring. So at this point my $29 camera is 100% more reliable than a $229 Ring camera. Right before I wrote this I looked at Live View and it keeps saying ""trying to reconnect"". Pressed it 15 times.  Nothing. Going to be calling them today.  If there's no upgrade bug fix in the VERY near future Ring Doorbell 3 Plus is getting replaced with another brand. UPDATE 2: Just hung up with support and they tell me it's wifi issues. "" I should buy a Chime Pro"" or contact my internet provider. Well.. I have 3 other cameras way further than this Ring Doorbell and come to think of it this is the closest one to my router. I have excellent wifi throughout the property. After reading other reviews that have had no success with purchasing the Chime Pro to correct ""wifi issues"" I think I've made a decision.

"Great potential — but Launched with Bugs","Was super excited to Finally get this doorbell — been waiting almost 2 months for the release — I have the Ring Security System and this doorbell really completes it — especially pairing with my Schlage Lock — I can now unlock (Or lock) my door directly from the Ring app when someone is at the door. So after all that waiting, I was super disappointed that they shipped me a defective unit. ;( the battery was on pace to die after 6-7 days. *I’ll describe it more fully below* Ring customer support was great and they are shipping me a new one through Amazon. Will update my review after I test that one. ****Review Update 4/25, right before the replacement ring arrived they updated the firmware and magically my doorbell started to charge and finally reached 100%, as it should have). I’ve noticed it drain down to 95% a few times over the last month, but clearly this was an early firmware issue that they resolved. Future orders should be fine ****** In terms of quality picture — it’s fantastic. Ease of installation — awesome. Performance — works great, detected all relevant motion and has nice features to reduce false positives and non human motion. Integrations — love how it connects into my smart home tech (I.e my Schlage lock) AND the Amazon Integration is great with my Echo Show — the alert comes to my kitchen device and the live video pops up on the screen if the doorbell is pressed. The only integration that sucks is with my Samsung Fridge — nothing pops up there — but truthfully that is Samsung’s fault — they have gone downhill from their vision and their marketing no longer matches what their products actually do. Whoever makes end user software decisions is clueless and un-customer centric — probably a lawyer. The only reason I am rating this 3 star — is they shipped me a defective unit. Serious battery drain. Ring It’s supposed to get ~6 months of use before the battery needs recharged, BUT I connected mine to a strong power source and so it should not only (not drain) but simply sit there, trickle charging, and acting as a backup. Instead my battery went down like 15% in one day. That means it only would have lasted like 7 days. Which is ridiculous. Especially considering I connected it to a primary Power Source — it should never die. I talked to Ring Support — who was great — and they said my doorbell was constantly restarting itself and draining the battery. So they told me to ask amazon to replace it. I’m keeping it at 3 stars until I receive and can test the replacement. But man, what a disappointment. Be careful, if mine is any indication they launched this product with bugs. Maybe it’s hardware, maybe it’s firmware. While I wait for the new device to arrive I noticed ring pushed a firmware update last night and my battery drain has slowed substantially.  So that is a positive sign that they are fixing the issue.","11 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","JWK","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0"
"Installation is easier with a drilling template.","I found the Ring Doorbell 3 Plus really easy to install -- once I realized I needed a drilling template.  I'm surprised they don't include one in the box. I simply used a 3x5 inch index card and a 1/8"" drill bit to make a template from the doorbell's mounting holes.  I then transferred the relative locations of those holes to my brick wall using a sharpie.  The index card was necessary because I couldn't get a pen, pencil, or marker to fit through the mounting holes in the doorbell itself! Software setup was easy.

The field of view, responsiveness, sound quality and quality of the picture are much, much better on the Ring Doorbell 3 than the first generation unit.

"Great device","Don’t listen to the negative reviews. It was easy to connect to my SmartThings and setting up wifi is similar to google. When you connect to the network you have to disconnect your existing network and connect to the device with your phone or tablet. I was able to connect it through my existing hardwire doorbell and my existing doorbell ring worked as well. You just have to go through the ring app and turn that feature on. The video is clean, vivid and not choppy. I connected to my 5ghz network and the signal works just fine. I tested it multiple times with no issues. When someone rings the device my doorbell rings and my Amazon Alexa announces someone is at the front door. A banner popups up and on it and live view activates. The ring service is $30 a year. I also tried it through my fire tv and when asked show me the front door my TV screen went straight to live view. No app needed. Just remember to add the ring skill on your Alexa software and do a search for the device to add it. Once that’s done your set. I barely looked at the directions to set all this up.","31 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DLAGuBZwL._SY88.jpg","Yes","John","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=0"

"Update: Over all happy with purchase","Updated: Sept 11, 2020. Changing to 5-star rating for two reasons, the outstanding customer service, and receiving a replacement that is working 100% the way it should. There were many emails back and forth to try and get my ring 3 working. After trying all possible remedies customer service sent me a new ring 3. I installed it 2 days ago and it is up and running without any of the problems I had in the past. So if you do have a problem rest easy knowing the Ring backs up their product and will make it right. Here's the pros/cons for me. Great picture quality and night vision are the pros, motion detection is really the only con I have. Even though I have set up the detection for the 5-15 feet range and have blocked 3 of the 4 areas you are allowed to it is still picking up traffic going by on the street which is about 40 feet from the door. Short of putting up a wall on my sidewalk (which I am sure the neighbors would love) I do not see any way of fixing this. I notice that many other reviewers have the same problems with setting distance and motion detection. Not sure if Ring will/can do a software fix for this but they should. So I guess that annoying detection is better than none at all.","03 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fyiAsl4gL._SY88.jpg

"So bad it made me cry 3 times and have an anxiety attack","I’m a third generation carpenters daughter. I also work in the tech field. I know tools. I know instillation. I know electronics. I’ve assembled and installed literally everything from furniture to appliances in our entire house. Installing this product made me cry 3 times, have an anxiety attack, and have to take medications to calm down. I’ll admit I was having a bad day already when I tried to put this thing together.  But the instructions are ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL! I had to watch 3 Yoitube videos just before I could figure out how you’re supposed to attach the stupid slanting brackets. The device told me it was “entering setup mode” after I put in the battery, and then sat there blinking for 35 minutes. Finally I got mad, tried to figure out what what happening, and discovered that I was supposed to be setting it up on the app while it was doing this. There was zero mention in the instructions of this. I thought “setup mode” meant it was looking for WiFi, or triangulating it’s location or something like that. How am I supposed to known that when it says it’s entering setup mode I’M supposed to do the setup. There are zero instructions on what the different screws and things are for. I can’t even finish explaining all the nightmares involved in setting this nightmare up. Setup sucks, the product sucks, the quality sucks. I hated it out of sheer spite for what it put me through for several hours during setup, but now I absolutely loathe it for how crummy and confusing it is. If it ever breaks I’m not returning it, I’m just going to throw it in a bonfire and dance around it.

"Don't Blame Device for User Error","I had my 3 Plus installed in less than 5 mins. You will have to charge the battery for many hours though to reach full capacity. Connected to my 5Ghz Ubiquiti access point SSID with no issues. RSSI of 57 which is just fine. For the people complaining about dropped signal what's your RSSI? Anything steady over 60 can cause video issues. Anything over 70-75 you'll be dropping the connecting. Over 80 forget it. In reading the negative comments several things come to mind: This unit is placed outside. It's a whole other ballgame when you place a wifi device outside of your home. My access point is in the main hallway ceiling around 25 feet from the doorbell through a stucco exterior wall and gets plenty of signal. There are around 6 different settings pertaining to motion and motion detection that have to be set right for your particular location. It took me a day to get it all set right. This is consumer DIY alarm equipment. This isn't a $3,000 wired professional alarm system install with a $35 a month monitoring contract. For the $300 in equipment I've invested and the $100 a year pro motioning plan I'm more than satisfied with Ring.

"Some issues, pretty great overall.","The thing works. It damn well better by version 3, but still. I haven't found any real glitches. The one major issue I have so far is that you are not able to set the pre roll (which is the camera recording the 4 seconds before motion is detected so you get a better view of what happened) to color and higher definition. They say that's to conserve battery power, which is beyond stupid considering the vast majority of people have their Rings hardwired. If there's one thing I can't stand it's a company removing the option of choice from the consumer because they think they know better, and that's exactly what this is. Especially obnoxious because the preroll footage is completely unusable and pointless. I've attached a snapshot of what the preroll footage looks like, and another of what the footage looks like in normal mode a split second later. From garbage to actually usable. But everything else about the product is pretty outstanding. Hopefully they will change the preroll options in the future.","30 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NAismh8ZL._SY88.jpg

"Turn off your VPN to set up!","My neighbor recently stopped by with some pictures of a sketchy character on his porch.  I had some cameras set up but my coverage was a little lacking so I went ahead and bought this.  It arrived quickly and I took to installing and setting it up right away.  First issue- I couldn't get an account set up.  I kept on getting error after error while trying to set it up on my iphone.  By chance I turned off my VPN and it magically allowed my account to be created.  The rest of the setup process was a bit of a grind as random errors and freezes plagued the process.  I think the VPN was turning itself on and that was creating the problems. Now on to the install.  My existing doorbell is wired into the door moulding and with a storm door also attached there was little room for the Ring Doorbell to attach.  I solved that problem by cutting a block of wood to fit next to the moulding so that the Ring would have something to attach to (not so easy since I have fiber cement siding).  Once that was done install was easy. Now that it's installed I have the same problem with the VPN.  I have to turn it off to connect to the doorbell, but it's a minor inconvenience until I find a workaround. The picture quality is great, the motion detection (at least for me anyways) is a work in progress (seems to pick up movement of flowers and flags).  I originally hooked it up to my existing chime but once I found out that you can use your Alexa devices to ring throughout the house I set it up that way.  You have many ring tones to choose from (including some seasonal).  Pretty cool. Overall my particular setup was a little involved but now that it's running I would certainly recommend.","03 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IwsimootL._SY88.jpg","Yes","pshultzma","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2"
"Old body, New features","So this product was a bit of a confusing thing to me due to looking exactly like the RVD2 and yet they still have that model vs replacing it with this. Now a bit of context here, I use to work for Ring for over three years during pretty critical product launches and then quit a year after Amazon acquired them (Amazon ruined most of the Ring spark that made it good working there). So overall I'll lay out the good and bad for you Pros- 1080p video that looks better then both the peephole and RVD2 - snapshot (captures an image every hour or 14 minutes depending on your selection) - overall a better motion sensor then RVD classic and RVD2, which means less false motion at least in my case - I think there's been some improvements internally to increase battery life as this now lasts then my previous RVD2 - Adjustable motion zones - 2.4ghz and 5ghz Wi-Fi support - Privacy zones Cons- Outdated and boring looking design - Pre-roll feature will show on the RVD3 but does not work, it's restricted to the $30 more expensive Video Doorbell 3 + which I think is a poor decision as that device shouldn't exist and is clearly Amazon trying to milk more money from consumers for a small feature - Ring Protect Plan is still too expensive in my option and should offer a plan that is half priced for say storing the videos for 30 days instead of the 60 that it normally does (you can remotely save videos on your PC/Mac if you login in online if you needed to save an important one. Also Ring will say ""They can't recover or access your videos if you didn't have the protect plan"" but that's totally false, they can and will but normally act like it's impossible. I've seen it done from an angry customer requesting them and they will also ""find"" them if you get a police subpoena for a crime ) So in all this really isn't worth the extra cost if you can get the RVD2 at $100-$150, and the RVD3+ is utterly pointless unless you REALLY want that extra 4 seconds of video before a motion although it's not going to work all the time and looks bad in night vision. 5.5/10","09 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Adam Goodwin","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"

"Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Still not fully refined.","Update: 5/27/20 Ring customer support reached out to me based on my review. It was determined that wifi signal was less than optimal. Connected doorbell to ring chime which increased a signal a bit. After a week, the cheap Ring Chime signal to the doorbell declined and would no longer perform well as a signal repeater.  So I switched back to connecting Ring doorbell directly to wifi router.  Signal remains a steady -45 (Ring told me the range was fine and they like to keep it under -50 or so). The primary reason for the Doorbell update is the fact that the product does not work as advertised. It has some fatal flaws which are consistent and repeatable and I would certainly imagine are well known. 1. You cannot view the doorbell live until AFTER the motion detection and video has completed processing. Imagine you receive an alert that ""motion is detected"" or ""someone is at your door"" and you want to quickly view what or who it is.  You can't.  Let me repeat:  You cannot view live events.  20 seconds for the video capture, another 10-15 seconds for ""video processing"" .............. and NOW you can connect to your doorbell in LIVE VIEW. RING...please update your product features to say:  ""View your historical events after the burgler is gone"" and ""You can view your doorbell camera live only when nothing is happening and there is no active events occurring"" I have tested this use case dozens of times.  I can sit in the same chair in my office and GO LIVE and view my doorbell in live mode within 4 seconds.  However sitting in the same chair, receiving a RING Doorbell alert... forget it.  May as well take another couple sips of coffee because you're not viewing anything live until the doorbell is done processing the event.  (I was also told that they made a new app ""RAPID RING"" I suppose to help circumvent the issue.  I used that app as well.  Same thing - works great... when you want to view your quiet front porch but won't go into live view when there is an active event occurring). The second big flaw:  The doorbell has a feature which allows you to only receive motion alerts when people are detected. This is a great feature because I want to capture the cars that go by in the street but don't need to be alerted.  This feature works great at night and mid-day.  Somehow the artificial intelligence of the system cannot identify a car driving by in the morning or dusk.  It's the funniest thing because around our house, we know it's around 6-7am  and 6-7pm all the time because we'll start getting a barrage of ""unverified motion"" events to our devices.  Then as soon as it turns night somehow the doorbell begins recognizing that the motion is a car again and quiets down. Overall, a very frustrating piece of broken firmware and app software. p.s. I won't even go into what occurs when you install the software on multiple devices.  Let them explain the settings to you.  (some settings propogate to all devices when you change them on one..... other settings you have to change on each and every device.  what a lazy mess of a software debacle). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Overall a good product but NOT as refined as I had hoped for a brand new version of the hardware and software. 1. I paid extra money for the Ring Doorbell 3 PLUS for the pre-roll feature. (captures the moments before motion is detected).  The pre-roll feature is black and white, which I knew ahead of time, but the quality is just not good enough to make the feature worth while. It provides no value and certainly not worth the extra price difference for the Video Doorbell 3 base model. 2. Contacting the doorbell to view it live to see who is there is sporadic. Sometimes it's instant and sometimes it just sits there and waits. This is a critical feature. I need it to contact and connect to the Doorbells live view from the cloud each time, every time, all the time. 3. The software has new features but installing it on more than one device and it gets ""wonky"" Tweaking the settings somehow get out of synch (especially so if you also use the new Ring Chime - sounds and alerts, etc.). 4. They should offer the Ring Cloud service Free for Prime Members. The product is pointless without paying the montly subscription fee.  Since Amazon owns Ring, why make the loyal customer feel like they are getting ""Ring Dinged"" What I do LOVE about the product is it's ease of installation and setup. (STRONG ADVICE:  Charge the battery FULLY before installation and setup. If you fail to do this, the software may always indicate the wrong charge levels. It took nearly 5 hours to fully charge the battery). The battery is removable and replaceable.  I installed and attached to existing doorbell wires. Hooking up the two wires took 5 minutes and the wires continue to recharge the battery. The daytime video quality is excellent.  The motion detection and the ability to tweak motion parameters is also excellent.  (I appreciate the flexibility the software provides to allow me to set up motion detection for everything including cars driving by, but only alert me if it detects an actual person). As I said, overall, a good product. a bit more refinement was expected.  I overpaid for the PLUS model which I would not recommend. I trust performance and software updates will improve but should be rock solid already and it's just not.","30 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","B.L.","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"

"Very overpriced anyway but Ring app makes it unusable.","It gets two stars because it works sometimes and when it does, the quality is excellent. There's a been a lot of hype about Ring's cameras, in particular the doorbells. I bought 2 of the 3+ models. The video quality is admittedly good. That's about it. Sure, it's a nice looking design, but that's not what I paid a premium for. That's the positives. There's really nothing else to sing about. The FOV is 160, which I thought would be enough. It might be if I put the doorbells at waist level. It was my hope that I could use these to prevent package theft but there's enough of a blindspot that if a person bent over, they could shove something in their pocket and walk away without the action even being witnessed. You'd see the person come to your door, bend over and then leave. So over $200 for circumstantial evidence. I thought about just getting the cheap model with the 180 FOV because the other features would be enough but then I remembered the Ring app. The app makes the doorbells completely unusable. Let me start by saying that my door is literally 3 feet from my dual-band router so it's most definitely not that. Let's forget for a moment that the UI is terrible. Really bad. For example, to even delete each of the bells I had to search through 3 menus deep, all of them called ""Settings"". There's more but that's a good example. But aside from the UI, it simply doesn't work. 4/5 times, if I clicked ""Live View"" it would try for about 30 seconds saying ""Activating"" but then complain it couldn't. I had to keep tapping ""Retry"" and eventually it would connect. The motion sensors don't always work and I don't mean small motions. I initially intended to elaborate on this review, but I spent so much time trying to get it to work that I don't have it in me anymore. I've wasted enough time on these. And I haven't even addressed that if you have 3 of these units, you'll also have to pony up another $9 a month regardless of whatever else you have with Amazon (like Prime) or how much you've spent.","28 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Christopher Estep","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"
"Not good for security device","I purchased the ring door bell a few weeks ago. It comes with one month of free recording service that requires the payment of a monthly subscription after that. I searched for a way to connect it to a dvr but there is no interface for that. At least not to the end user. There must be something or the company would not be able to record either. With the use of the service the response time to allow you to view what was recorded is very slow. By the time the device connects to your internet and displays the video, that the person and or motion created, so much time has elapsed that the event is over and the person is gone. There is also no way to just watch in real time what is going on. By this I mean that there is no way to display a constant feed on a monitor inside your house. Alexa will display the live feed but only for a short period of time. The lag time is so great that there is no way to really answer your door remotely. By the time you know who is there they are leaving and could just as easily breaking in. Pro: good camera resolution good night vision Con: No way to connect to DVR Subscription fee required to continue remote recording lag time to great to be an effective security device","01 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Yvonne Knight","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"
"Not really worth the $$","8/2/20 Update—- same problem. Customer support got it working but now I haven’t had a live picture since 7/17. It will not reconnect. It’s passed the window to return so it is wasted money. It disconnects all the time due to too many things connected. The ring just made WiFi worse. I got another router which was $100 which barely made any improvements to ring but helped my WiFi somewhat. I bought the ring chime pro which did nothing to boost connection or WiFi for the ring. I cannot move the router/modem any closer and it’s really not that far away. Most of the time it doesn’t pick up anyone outside due to connection. It is hardwired in but that didn’t make a difference.,so after spending all this extra money to make it better, nothing helped. I guess if I buy an upgraded WiFi package but that’s just more money on top of what I already spent. Honestly, I’m ready to return the ring and ring chime pro. I have d-link cameras that work much better and gave night vision. Way cheaper and didn’t require all this extra $ to get it or keep it connected and they are on WiFi only not hard wired.","23 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Heidi","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"
"needs much improvement, went bad in 15 days","Replaced my ring doorbell 2 with this doorbell 3 at my front door.  Kept the 2, because it's great.  This doorbell 3 is basically a doorbell 2 with supposed new features.  Motion zones are suppose to be better, they really aren't, you actually get a slider in the doorbell 2,this one you can't adjust the range, just unselect generic areas.  You can tell the app how far away from the street you are, but it doesn't make any difference in the app, it still gives you generic ranges, which are exactly the same.  Seems like a step backwards.  The slider on the doorbell 2 with the car symbol was actually really great.  That's gone with this. This is supposed to have ""improved wifi.""  It really doesn't, in fact it's worse.  My doorbell 2 had an rssi of 48 at my front door, this doorbell 3, with the same router in the same location, and doorbell mounted in the same spot, has a worse signal, with an rssi of 71... My router is 10 feet from this.... Unless Ring improves the firmware and takes advantage of the features, this is really nothing new and special, it's a repackaged doorbell 2. Picture quality is great, same as the doorbell 2, no difference.  Motion detection is basically the same, after testing it upon install. I'm keeping this in hopes they improve the firmware and app software, otherwise I would have tried finding a discounted doorbell 2. ** called support about the terrible wifi, they had no answer other than suggesting an extender... For a doorbell 10 feet from the router.... **update, after owning this for 15 days, the audio microphone now stopped working properly.  Some times no audio, and sometimes choppy.  I swear, I got a defective unit from the start, sending back for a replacement.","12 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","g man","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3"

Every time I have to set it put the battery back in, it takes at least an hour and over 15 tries to get the doorbell to reconnect to the wifi.

"Undecided","At this point, I'm undecided as to how I feel about the Ring video doorbell. If I set it to pick up human movement only, it sends a 'movement at front door' message is a car drives by a couple hundred feet away while not even noticing if I go outside and stand in front of the doorbell.  If I switch it back to monitor all movement, it's messaging every time a bird flies by, a car drives by and sometimes we can't even figure out what it sees at all.  So it seems to be a choice between wearing out the batteries of both the doorbell & my phone along with getting messages about someone driving down the street 500 ft away... OR not know when someone is standing in front of our door.","08 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","J.

"After your 30 day free trial, you must purchase a yearly plan through Ring to view your recordings","The product itself works great, the problem lies with the Ring service itself. A word of caution to those looking to buy a Ring video doorbell: When you first set up a new device, you get 30 days free of video recording. After the 30 days is up, you can no longer view any video recordings triggered by the motion activation on your video doorbell *unless* you purchase a ""Ring Protect Plan"" through Ring.  The cheapest subscription is $30/year that works for *one* device. The other plan is $100/year that works with all devices. You can still view the live feed of your video doorbell, and it still functions normally, however, unless you purchase a plan you can no longer view any recordings that your device makes.  In my opinion, considering how much you pay for the product, it's obnoxious you have to pay a subscription fee to view 20 second recordings.

"Returning the product, motion detection and network issues","i would not recommend this product, to anyone. The motion detection leaves a lot to be desired. I've messed around with the settings, sensitives, zones, ""smart"" detection, etc. and nothing seems to work. The Ring will pick up passing vehicles 40+ feet away, but not pickup the USPS worker dropping the package off on my porch. Also if i enter or leave either side of my house (which is within the supposed range/zones of the Ring), it does not pickup the motion. I do have 3 step up to my porch and installed the wedge to angle it downward. I've also tried it without the wedge and there was no notable difference. Lastly, the network connectivity is spotty at best. I'll often get delayed/no alerts or i'll have videos stuck in ""processing."" It's not my Internet, i have an Orbi mesh-network with 300mbps speeds. No devices in my household have any issue with internet connection, so it has to be the Ring. The night vision and video quality are good, when it works. But if the motion detection isn't working correctly or i can't watch the videos without it taking forever to process, then what good is the video quality? I'll be caulking the 2 screw holes in my vinyl siding and returning the product ASAP.","18 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","scott","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4"
"Good enough, but not 'great'","There is much to like about this doorbell. It does what it needs to do as a smart doorbell and the picture quality is decent. It attaches to my Alexa dot (as a chime and answering device) so that is also a plus. So what are its downfalls? #1. The sound is abysmal. It simply isn't loud enough for people to hear you well.  I actually use my porch Echo Dot to 'drop in' and speak to people, since this doorbell is so depressingly low in output noise. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.  It is noisy on my street, and it renders communication useless by itself. #2. You have to pay for a subscription to have it save video of motion and rings. Utterly ridiculous. You should be able to have it save the videos to your phone, cloud of your choice, etc. Forcing a subscription for something that should be standard is tacky. #3. Minor, but you should be able to change the 'light' on a wired Ring. You should be able to have it on or off, and possibly even have a phone operated 'dimmer'. How is this missing on such an expensive ringer? Anyway, I like it well enough, but I think I would go with a different doorbell if I was doing it again.","13 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Kemp Kennedy","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4"
"Great Doorbell and Great Customer Support from Ring","UPDATED UPDATE: Other than freezing when I attempt to answer a ring, the doorbell has worked fine. The main reason I wanted it was to know when my mail came and when packages were delivered. I have the chime that goes DING DONG when there's motion. That has worked fine until today. I was waiting, waiting, waiting for two packages to be delivered. No ring from the chime. Finally, I looked online and the packages had been delivered an hour ago. I opened the door to get them, and no ring sounded at my motion. Two little red lights were flashing on both sides of the doorbell button. When I rang the doorbell, those lights when out, and now it seems to be working fine. I have no clue why it didn't get the delivery. No ring, no picture. Nothing. I've had mine since April. I didn't expect it to stop working after only 7 months. UPDATED REVIEW : I'm changing my rating because of the incredible support I got from Ring. Luis advised me to get the Ring Chime Pro Wi-Fi Extender. I did. He helped me connect my Ring Doorbell 3 to the Chime Pro Network and connect the Chime Pro, which helped with my Internet connection. Now, my videos are playing fine and not freezing. Anyone who has connection problems should try the Chime Pro Wi-Fi Extender. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this Ring Doorbell 3 because it got a top rating at CNET. I had an electrician install it yesterday and hardwire it. It worked fine yesterday afternoon and this morning. Now, every time I get a motion notification and open it, it says it's trying to connect. Then when the video opens, it freezes. The bar is still moving,  but there is no movement. People in the frame are frozen. No motion.","19 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Millie Lee","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4"
"Disappointing","Got our Ring 3 today. We've always wanted one and after all the great reviews on the 2 we figured the 3 would be even better. Our battery makes no good contact to the base. So our power is intermittent at best. We called the support before they closed and were given some 'hacks' and still nothing is working. We got a faulty product. We'll be calling in the morning and asking for another unit. From what LITTLE (Very little few moments) we could get it working the picture quality is superb. Now we just need it to actually work. Also the person we talked to with Ring for a good 40 minutes tonight? Totally blew us off and told my husband 'oh it will be alright' but my husband is a tinkerer. If he says there's a battery connection error he knows what he's talking about. Hopefully tomorrow someone will listen June 12 Update: They are sending us a new Ring Doorbell. It will take 5 business days to get here. June 25th Update: When it works it's really good. The image is good and the sound quality is ok. The battery? Is not gonna last as long as they claim. Also the phone notifications are spotty as is the live feed even if you have a wifi extender. I think a lot of these issues are a poorly updated app vs anything else. I get a lot of black boxes between my feed as snapshot stopped working on day 2. So I took off the snapshot feature. Now it will capture video great. But notifications and live feed are spotty at best. Btw my wifi is fantastic and my cheap $30 Chinese security camera has never had issues like these So I've upgraded this from 2 stars to 3 and if they ever fix the issues I'll update it again.","11 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Rocks","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5"

"Expensive, Subscription Required, Poor Connection","I used to be a big fan of Ring, but it went from a small company, to another subscription scam. I purchased a Ring for my parents after having a Ring doorbell myself for many years. Because I had done some beta testing, I have had free video storage. The issue is that it has incredible difficulty connecting to the WiFi. My parents router is right in the other room AND I bought them the chime with WiFi extender and they still cannot connect live to see who is at the door. If they want to see who is at the door, they have to watch the video after it has processed which requires spending MORE money on a subscription. I would completely understand charging people if they’d like to keep the videos for 24+ hours, but you can’t even view what happened 1 minute ago without paying So, to reiterate, the Ring barely connects, and if you try to see the video a moment later after it processes, you have to pay for a subscription. On top of the $$$ you spent on the doorbell. So here ends my recommendation of Ring to anyone. I’m embarrassed I purchased one for my parents and will be returning it. The doorbell is expensive, the subscription model is poor, and the connection is subpar.","27 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Ally","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5"

And just now missed an Amazon delivery.  Thankful for Amazon return policy. ... I'm so disappointed. This captures every car that goes by, but just today missed the mail carrier (who was in view of the camera as she walked up the driveway and then stood in front of the ring doorbell to deliver the mail); captured me driving onto my driveway but missed me walking to the front door or standing there to unlock it (again, had to walk in front of the doorbell to do that).  It did catch the UPS delivery guy at the door, but not his truck as he pulled up. Burglars and package thieves have little to fear! Pretty low random chance of being seen.

"WIFI issues and more make this one useless","I've had the original Ring for 2 years or so. It worked and rarely lost signal. The big issue was that you had to remove the Ring from your door to charge it, which would have to be done at least once a week or more often, depending on the motion setting. I purchased the solar charger, which was very hit and miss. The lower resolution compared to the Ring 3 wasn't great, but it was sufficient. So I was excited when Ring announced the supposedly improved Ring 3 Pro. I love that Ring 3 Pro now has a replaceable battery - when it's low, you take out just the battery pack and charge that separately, and you keep the Ring screwed on to your door. Nice. I also liked the increased resolution - at least on paper. In practice, it doesn't really matter. The HUGE issue and deal killer is that after a month of successfully using the Ring 3 Pro, I can now no longer connect to Wifi. It would drop and not reconnect. So I un-paired the device, and then went through the entire setup process. And again. And again. And again. It never worked, even though the router is in the exact same position, has the same signal strength and there are no new barriers between the router and the Ring 3, I can no longer connect the device to the router, making it useless. Ring in general is full of compromises but you can live with them - but not when it can't connect to your Wifi, which is the way this thing works ( unless you opt for the hardwired option which isn't possible for many of us.) When the Ring 3 Pro did work (first month), I didn't like that it took more than twice the time to connect and ring on my connected devices. For example, when someone rang my old Ring 1 doorbell, it took about 2 seconds until I got the notification on my iPad and phones. With the Ring 3 Pro, it took about 10 seconds. That's bad, but I could live with it. But now it's not working AT ALL, because of the Wifi issue. And judging by the other reviews here, I'm not alone. Other issues: night vision motion trigger is hit and miss, but this may be to the confusing motion settings. The quality of night vision itself is very good (when it worked) . This leads me to the motion settings which are...odd. You can narrow down what triggers motion, and when. Want only people to trigger a motion alert? There's an option for that. Except it doesn't work properly. It missed UPS, FedEx and Amazon delivery persons numerous times, and those guys were right at the door. It's a bad product, plain and simple. It's overpriced for what it does, and buggy. For a big company - owned by one of THE biggest tech companies on earth: Amazon -  this shouldn't be the case. It's too late to return this item now so I'm stuck with a $200 dollar dummy camera on my door. Not recommended, unfortunately.","02 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","R.B.","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5"

I also liked looking at the few second recordings when motion was detected and everything seemed to work great.

There of course isn’t but you can’t tell that because the camera gets an error at that same time. So at this point we’re looking into other cameras to record when this stupid thing tells us there’s motion in the middle of the night. Doesn’t do a lot of good as a security device if it startles you at 3am and then doesn’t let you actually see if something is happening. I definitely wouldn’t recommend getting this especially for the price and then they want you to pay per month as well. We have better options through our cable company that would have cost the same but actually worked without an extra monthly fee.","27 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","MommaBradley413","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"

"Battery does not last as advertised.","I had this doorbell cam for approximately 8 days with an approximate 4 'events' per day.. The events are mostly 'sensing motion' when the mail carrier comes to the door, or delivery people dropping things off. Checking battery life I am down to 80 percent from a full charge. At that rate, the battery will be dead in less than a 5 weeks.  6 to 12 months?  Maybe if you live in the woods and don't never activate the camera..  Perhaps the amount of deliveries is really affecting the battery life, since I am stuck at home and a more than usual number of people are coming to the door? I will update when I am down to 10 percent, and need to charge to have a better idea of how often *you* will need to charge.","14 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Jason Holloway","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"Reliable (don’t expect to be wowed)","Overall it’s a great product and what you expect from Ring/Amazon. The picture quality is good and and the motion detection has been very impressive compared to the Ring 1 that I just upgraded from. The Cons: 1.) integration with Alexa- the live video display on your show devices takes long...like you might as well just open the door and find out who it is before waiting forever for the video to show if it does at all. 2.) Upgrading from a previous Ring- if you’re upgrading from a Ring 1 like I did, be aware that the design of this mounting bracket is going to give you a headache. You would think the drilling holes to mount the bracket would remain in the same place as the old version since the device is the same size...wrong. You will have to caulk and re-drill new holes for this bracket. Pros: Faceplate- the two faceplates that ship with the device (basic silver and oil rubbed bronze) are a nice option to match the outdoor aesthetic Apartment living- I live in an apartment with no existing door bell. If you have a ring and your home has Alexa devices they will act as a doorbell chime when the button is pressed. This is very nice and eliminates the need for a Ring Chime. In addition, through IFTTT and Phillips Hue you can actually select to have certain (or all) lights in your home blink in addition to the chime. I LOVE this feature for on my outdoor patio to see the lights blink and know someone is at my door. All in all it’s a great product. If you’re looking to upgrade from a previous Ring I’d suggest wait for a better release because this won’t blow your socks off. But if you can get it for a good deal, (I.e. trade in special) it might be worth considering.","29 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Jon","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"Battery runs out even when it is hardwired","I have the doorbell hard-wired and have put the settings so that it records a lot. In that configuration, it drains the battery. I was under the impression that it should not need the battery when hardwired. That does not seem to be the case. The Support team is quite unclear about how it is supposed to work and to debug the issue. They are not able to connect the dots... but just recommend that I reduce the number of recordings. I don't want to spend more time with trial and error and plan to return it soon :-( Later update: On working with Ring specialized support team (they are great!), I learned that the hardwired Ring Video Doorbell 3+ does not actually use the wired power to run its operations. It relies on the battery for that. The trickle charge the Ring Video Doorbell 3+ gets from being hardwired is solely used to charge the battery. When there are a large amount of events (over 30-40/day), the battery may drain faster than it receives in the trickle charge. I had a lot of events and hence it was running into this problem. In that case, Ring Video Doorbell Pro works better as it actually uses wired power to run its operations and hence does not have a limit on the amount of events or recording it can support. So that is the right product for my situation. As such, I returned this and bought Doorbell Pro a few days ago and that has been working well. My suggestion to Ring: Given so many Ring Doorbell products, it should consider providing a better comparison on the website to allow users to pick the right product for their needs.","23 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Anoop","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"Wow....super easy😁✔","I am new to the ""ring"" system and had no idea what to do and so on. Got item in a timely manner as usual (Thanks Amazon), and right away got things in motion. Instructions are spot on and super easy to follow. PLEASE NOTE: Make sure you enable your ""Location"" on mobile device which you use to activate/set up ALL your ""ring"" gadgets.....you'll thank me for it later 🤗 Picture is crystal clear and it detects what you tell it to via settings. This is so simple to install, a 10 year old can do it. Night vision is great and once you decide where and how to mount it, you are all set and have a lot more peace of mind. I did not follow the recommendation of 4 feet height bc I felt I got better coverage and wider view at 5 feet. Since I am 5'3"" tall,  or, funsized as I like to call it🤗, I just wanted it to be a little lower than my height...not many folks are shorter than me 🤣, so placing it higher actually works perfectly for me, but, play around with it and see what suits you best. You get a 30 day trial (free service) and after that it's up to you which ring plan you want. Installation took about 10 minutes from unboxing to live view, and you get everything you need to mount/install , no need to run to the hardware store for ankers or screws ! They really made this dummy proof....and if I can mount/install this, than anybody can! Battery has long life, but I bought a spare battery, bc I bought another doorbell for my back door, so, while 1 is charging neither will be down. That's about all I got for you on this item.","02 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zIAkCWuaL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Eros","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"$$$ but worth it!","I was flabergasted by the price. But now having it, it's totally worth it!! I live in an apartment complex where someone was constantly going through and opening my packages. This ring video door bell makes me feel so much more secured.  My only issue was the installation. I was unable to drill holes into the frame, however, watching a youtube video, I purchased indoor/outdoor scotch tape (best $8 ever) that the doorbell does not budge. The video is very clear and the app was so easy to navigate. The app alerts me whenever motion is detected (this feature can be adjusted on app) and also updates you on security items that are happening in your area (car burglaries to pets missing). This item is amazing and I highly recommend it!","08 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Jasmine Smith","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"Stay away from this.","*Update added* So far, I'm not very impressed. I installed this, after charging the battery. I went outside, it seemed to work and notified me I was there. Cool. Then, I had some other packages delivered from other websites besides Amazon, and it did not notify me. They delivered the package not even 4 feet to the right of the ring. Going to my ""premium trial recorded video"" on the app, it just randomly appears, after it skips 15 seconds. No parked vehicles shown, no one walking, etc. Okay... We all have small issues. Last night, when it went from daylight, to night, it literally goes from bright outside, skips 15 or so seconds, and then it's somehow dark dark night. It doesn't show transition, it just goes from 5:40pm bright, to 5:41pm or something, dark black night. I get home today, and same thing, it doesn't register that I'm there, it doesn't register my truck pulling in, or me walking up to the front door. It doesn't work, and if it continues this, I'll have to return it within the time frame allotted from amazon. I'm kind of annoyed that this thing was nearly $200, and has so many issues within the first day or two. *Update 9/8/20* Following my previous posting of this review, I received an e-mail from a representative from Ring at 12:32pm, apparently I did not answer fast enough, and she messaged again 1:39pm, with a quote of the previous message in it the new e-mail. I responded and told her I would get back to her when I had free time due to running my company. The response was that she did not mean to send another e-mail, (remember, she had quoted the previous message, so this seemed odd.) After 3 days of me not messaging to have her tell me what I had already figured out from the instructions when I first installed it to begin with, she messaged again to get in contact, and eventually closed the report 2 days after that. I did not contact them during this period, in full disclosure. Today is the first day my 'trial' period is over, and I cannot access my ring. I cannot use it for live video, and literally everything is setting it off. It seems like as soon as your trial period is over, they reset all of the previous settings and do not allow for any usage of a nearly $200 piece of equipment. This is absolutely ridiculous, and I HIGHLY suggest everyone stay away from it unless you are willing to constantly pay a monthly fee just to use it, even at the most basic of functions advertised. This hunk of excrement would have been returned if I had not had the high hopes, and already thrown away the box it came in. Waste of money.","11 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","NinjaXij","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"
"Kind of cool expensive doorbell with technical issues (*UPDATED +2 star for Technical Support)","UPDATE 7/25/2020 Just wanted to add that Tech Support is pretty good. *TL;DR? 6/23/2020 - Ring Support Updated the Firmware *3-Battery Drain: Firmware Update 6/23 Resolved 7/25 Still have not needed to swap out the battery. *4-Motion Detection: 6/23 Firmware & Optimized Motion Settings by Tech Support 7/25 Motion detection is still an issue for me due to delayed response. *5-WiFi: Firmware & 2.4G instead of 5G - 6/23 2.4G works better than 5G and appears to be resolved. 6/23 UPDATE: After only 4 days had to replace the battery again so called Ring Support. After a brief conversation with Daniel I felt reassured on 3 issues I noted below and will provide another update after some time has passed. Daniel was very polite and patient walking me through settings and remained on the phone for 45+ minutes. SmartHome integration has been slow for us and the Ring Doorbell 3 was a nice addition. Pro: Arrived as expected and packaging was hassle free and easy to unbox. Installation and setup was easy for me. Came with necessary tools plus some extra hardware I didn't need. Alexa integration and notifications are good. e.g., I like having the announcement ""Motion detected at your front door"", when it works. Video quality is very good, when it records. The Android App has some good features. I like having the announcement when I'm away. Note: I had originally purchased Ring Doorbell 2 from BestBuy and promptly returned it due to poor wireless connectivity, even with an extender 1 wall and 10 feet away, and reasons below. My hope was V3 would be worth the extra money. The added 5G support made some improvement but overall a disappointment. Con: First - The Price Tag. Just my opinion but seems way overpriced when compared to other IP cameras that are half the price or less that have local SD card storage. Sure, Ring offers some extra bells and whistles and 'cloud' storage but after the wow factor wears off probably won't think about them again. Not sure what I was thinking but I could have bought a complete 4 camera surveillance system with 1TB storage for the price of a Ring Doorbell 3, when not on sale. Second - The lack of industry streaming options like RTSP, even as part of the paid subscription, is a big miss. I do have other cams ($25ea) setup on my server monitor that support RTSP. *Third - Battery Drain while hardwired *UPDATE: Ring support updated the firmware which 'should' address battery drain problem. *Fourth - Motion detection is unreliable. After several attempts at Ring Wizardry it still detects cars on the street better than the Amazon guy walking up to my porch. In other words, a person can run up to the doorbell and not be detected. *UPDATE: Ring support walked me through changing some settings and also updated the firmware. *Fifth - Wireless support is better than V2 but still seems to be weak. My Netgear router extender is a standard wood frame outside wall and 10 feet away and I only get RSSI of 67. One would think something designed to work outside should work better outside. I have Wyze Cams that are 2x farther from the extender separated by 2nd floor structure. *UPDATE: Ring support updated the firmware which 'should' improve wireless and also advised on using 2.4G instead of 5G because it will work better through walls. Testing confirmed that I now get RSSI-51 instead of RSSI-65-70 (note that the lower RSSI number the better). Sixth - A subscription is only $30 a year but the fact that one is even required is a bit much to ask and one reason I almost didn't get Ring Doorbell 3. Even with a sub you only get 60 days playback. Having videos stored in the ever ubiquitous cloud is why no other Ring Cam device will be used here.","16 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","DRSherwood","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6"

"Easy Setup, User Friendly App & Good Quality Video","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus a month ago and my husband thinks it's the greatest invention ever made!  The day after I set it up he was at Home Depot shopping when he got the alarm from his phone that someone was at the door.  He pulled up the Ring app on his phone and our fence contractor was on our porch.  He talked to the contractor for a few minutes through the Ring.  He thought it was so cool that he could talk to the fence contractor who was on our front porch while he was in Home Depot! When I first unboxed the ring, the battery power was about 35%.  I was too excited to wait for it to charge so I downloaded the app, inserted the battery, and set it up.  (After setting it up, I charged the battery overnight.)  We never had a real doorbell, just an old-fashioned handle to twist a real bell and thankfully no one uses it anymore because it was so loud, that I would jump every time I heard it.  So, I love the rechargeable battery feature since we had no pre-existing electrical doorbell.  We bought a second battery a couple of weeks ago.  The battery says that it can last up to six months depending on your settings but we had to replace it after three weeks, but to be fair we did a lot of playing with it those first weeks. If you own one Ring video device there is a subscription of $3 per month and if you have two or more it's $10 per month.  So that means you can record, store, share, and view events whenever you want. After finding just the right spot for it I was able to set it up easily.  I was a little nervous because I did a lot of research about the Ring and mesh systems and there seemed to be a problem with the two being compatible but it flawlessly integrated into our new mesh system so that must be a problem of the past that no longer exists. At first, we were getting a lot of unwanted alerts so I went to settings then opened the motion wizard, and answered a few questions that seemed to help somewhat. what really helped was going into the motion zones and tweaking those.  I turned off the outer three zones of the yard and left on the ones that were closest to the house as well as turned down the motion sensitivity.  On almost every screen, there is a button marked ""live view"" so no matter what you're doing you can easily switch to a live view of your yard.  They also added a wedge with the setup kit to use if your front door is on a hill or upstairs so that it tilts the doorbell to make the camera angle just right. If you watch the video I posted, it's of a UPS driver dropping off a package.  Because of the motion sensitivity alert, I knew he was there before he rang the bell.  We didn't get the Ring Chime because we have 3 Alexa devices in the house that have a large array of doorbell chimes including seasonal ones.  We also have an Alexa Show that my husband took hostage on his bedside table so he can ask Alexa to show us who's at the door.  The Ring app also has quite a few chimes on it as well so you can switch up how your phone alerts you.  I really like the four-second pre-roll.  If you notice my video starts with the black & white pre-roll, and I read that it's black & white to save battery power, and then it turns to color.  I noticed that I could use my thumb and forefinger to make the video bigger so I can even see the expression on my husband's face as he's getting in the car. Another cool feature is once you set up the Ring and the app you are automatically and anonymously become members of a secondary app called ""Neighbors.""  You can decide how big you want your neighborhood to be.  It defaults to three miles radius around your house, but you can make it bigger or smaller.  It's good for posting videos of any wild animals you see through the Ring, lost animals, of course, you would want to post any crimes.  I saw a posting from my local police force asking if anyone had footage of the 200 block of Main St. on 9/28 between the hours of 5 - 6 p.m. because someone lit a car on fire and they were looking for evidence. I get between eight to ten packages per day because of my business so I am very glad to have the ring and I happily recommend it to everybody! Thank you for reading my review and I hope it helps you with making your purchasing decision!","16 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Mary Kate","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7"

I’m returning as either support or the product are not ready for prime time. Update Review August 14 (updated STARS based on device and last rep, not first experience): Ring customer service reached out by email in response to my review and set up a time to provide customer service on the device. First, as I discovered after the rep call and as verified by the person from Ring, I did not need to uninstall my installed (and silicone caulked) device in order to re-register it. The codes were on the box and on a slip in the box. Plus, as it turned out, the rep was not familiar with the current security setups (which cannot be bypassed) or with the setup issues since my doorbell did not need to be re-registered. Rather, with the informed and helpful rep, we were able to locate a setting on my Alexa device settings that was turned off an prevented its use as my doorbell. The rep was very polite and helpful. I am now happily using the device and -- about a week in -- it seems to be working well.

"Worst Purchase EVER - Don't Buy Unless You Plan to Subscribe","So this product worked perfectly until the trial subscription ended.  We only needed the RING doorbell to see who is at our doorstep and to be able to converse with them.  We have other cameras onsite to record and save video.  When we purchased RING, it was super sensitive and was sending notifications to my phone ALL the time for every leaf that blew by.  We adjusted the settings and were happy.  But the settings can only be adjusted to remove extreme sensitivity IF you have a subscription.  All other adjustments won't decrease the sensitivity to a manageable level.  But our biggest issue is that the RING does not work consistently with the app any longer.  If you can't view Live View, you can't chat with the person at your door and this purchase becomes a complete waste of money.

"Lackluster results","We've been using the Ring Doorbell 3 for the past few days now, and it is very hit or miss (mostly miss). The picture quality is ok, it's actually better at night without the sun glare heavily distorting the camera. But the motion detection, and even more-so the notification timing, leaves a lot to be desired. I've gone through the settings and setup motion zones, tried toggling ""People Only Mode"" on\off and adjusted the sensitivity rate, and nothing really hits the mark. We often get notifications of motion when nothing is there, a plant shifted in the wind, or a car is driving down the street. However, on 3 occasions now, we've had packages delivered right to our front door.... and nothing from ring. Nothing was recorded, no notification, no anything. Kinda defeats the purpose right? But if I walk out my front door, it will detect that. Also when a legit event is captured, by the time we receive the notification on our phones, the person has already left (such as me walking outside to get the mail, and walking back in before notification hits). Not sure what the deal is, but very unimpressed so far. I also picked up the Ring Chime Pro, and that will be getting returned to Amazon ASAP. Thinking the Ring Doorbell 3 will accompany the Chime on its journey back to the warehouse.","28 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Randy Moore","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7"
"This saved us from a home invasion","I am so happy to have bought this when I did. a few days prior to installing, I caught someone who appeared to be in the middle of  casing our house. I erred on the side of caution and bought the Ring 3 Plus after doing a little research. The next week we were visited 4 times in the same day by different people at different times and caught it all on video/audio. As it turns out there was a crew across the street ready to take us for everything we had once they identified the opportunity. I have never felt so protected by a piece of technology in my life and am thankful for my purchase. $3/mo for monitoring, person recognition, recording, and a slew of other features. I am happy to do it.","26 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Brad","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7"

"The installation instructions were greatly lacking but changed from 1 to 4 stars","I already had the 1st Ring, so I understand how it all works -- I even installed the previous one. The instruction book that is EXCELLENT for getting the Ring device up and going, but is limited for actually installing on the wall. It is vague, with pictures, that don't match the device. The GREAT news, I didn't know about is that it comes with a MUCH-NEEDED wedge! I was over the moon, until I realized the difficulty attaching it to the wall. I can attach the wedge to the device -- no problem, but attaching it to the wall is more obscure, as the wires need to be fed through its hole, which would have been useful to show, or at least mention! I eventually discovered that the plastic baggies with tools, have descriptions of what the items are used for. That wasn't readily apparent, but I see it now. It looks like the wedges were a very useful add-on, but not very integrated into the installation process, short of a small 3 inch 3-picture summary sheet. So I have no idea if I'll actually be able to do this. I'll update my review with my results. But I love the wedge! UPDATE: I had to get a neighbor to help me since the installation documentation had lots of issues in its lack of information (a template would be helpful) but we got it done. My Ring generation 1 was slow to respond and I frequently got the backside of someone, IF AT ALL, but when it worked, it was really helpful. The upgrade provided MUCH faster response time and the quality of picture allowed me to zoom in on delivered package labels. Amazing. And the neighborhood notification network, isn't spoken of often enough. It is really helpful. AFTER it was installed, I discovered a welcome email with connections to support, but I'd already passed my level of frustration and also was happy with the final installation. The mounting to the wall is the single biggest issue, so just understand that, and your compatibility or need for adaption not covered in any of the documentation, BUT it's all now worth it. The previous version CONSTANTLY dropped wifi connection, even after a booster being installed within 4 feet, so I'll update if this one does the same thing, but so far, so good.","11 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","goatesnotes","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8"
"Disappointing; slow, ineffective, rip-off","Pros: -easy to install - easy activation - good picture/sound quality. Cons:  everything else - wonky, clunky app (you’d think they’d have a simpler interface) - over sensitive (flag blows In the corner of the range or garbage truck passes 60 feet away and I get a motion detection and recording.. and this is with 3 zones deactivated and sensitivity decreased) - under sensitive (doesn’t register a delivery person placing a package from 4, feet away in the selected zone... but still seeing the flash and garbage truck - delayed notifications (About a quarter of the time I receive notifications of a person 2-3 minutes after the occurrence... this is with a doorbell place within 12 feet of the router and consistent WiFi connection) - recording only for a monthly fee.  So when I get a late notification, I won’t get to respond. In summary, I wanted to like it, really I did!  However, I think I could make as effective security/communication system using my old Radio Shack 101 kit from the 70’s (snap circuits for you younger crowd) or a pair of cheap two way radios with a basic WiFi camera.  I’m returning all three that I just bought because they are a waste of money.

"Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus useless unless you pay for monthly subscription!","I am very disappointed that I have to pay a monthly subscription in order to view my videos that was recorded by my Ring Video Doorbell. In the description, it's indicated that you will need the Ring Protect Plan (subscription sold separately), to record all your videos, review what you missed for up to 60 days, and share videos and photos. However, what they fail to tell you before purchase is that you will NOT be able to view any of your videos after a 30 day trial unless you pay a monthly fee. What a total rip-off... If I buy a video camera and record a 20 second video clip with it, that video clip should belong to me and I should have the right to save it to my computer or phone and view that video clip as I please. When you buy the Ring Video Doorbell, it becomes your property, and the videos that you record with it should be your property as well...

"Not reliable - Too many defective units","Often alerts of movement at the front door are delayed by as much as 3 minutes.  Some movements are missed entirely.  It's a nice unit but is not reliable as a security camera.  Also, when 2 alerts come in quick sucession the system gets confused.  The first alert and video of a mailman is fine, but when I go out a few minutes later to get the mail, the video starts out in color and then finishes in black and white, exactly opposite of what should happen.  Also, the verbal announcement comes 5 minutes later. Making me think a new alert has occurred. Also, activating the device is slow and recharging the battery takes much too time.  And because my  front door is in shade and the camera adjusts for that, areas in sunlight are overexposed and images are washed out.  Audio is also very poor, garbled. Unfortunately, Ring is not ready for prime time. Update:  Spent a half hour on the phone with Nicole at Ring support as she tried to solve some of my issues.  (She initiated the call based on my review, so kudos to Ring.)  Turns out that the central exclusion zone turns off only one sensor, but 2 adjacent sensors still pick up activity at the margins and gives unwanted, and supposedly excluded, alerts for passing traffic.  She also sent a list of Android add-on apps that will interfere with Ring - a long list.  But I don't have any of these.  She agreed that the often 5 to 10 minute delay is unacceptable but had no real solution other than to replace the unit with a more expensive security camera.  I told her that I only wanted the Ring to perform as advertised, and since the late notification makes it useless as a warning device, I will be returning the unit. Final update:  Working with Nicole has done nothing to fix my unit, and in fact, as time goes on more problems arise.  Even so, Nicole tells me that I will not be able to receive a replacement!  What kind of customer support is this?  I originally gave Ring 2 stars but that was much too generous.  I've now reduced it to 1 star although 0 stars would be more appropriate.  I can't speak for the many users who are happy with Ring, but I can say that purchasing a Ring Doorbell 3+ is a gamble and I suggest that you don't take the chance.","08 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Fooldagain","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8"
"Extremely disappointing","Update: 9/24/2020 Ring support has reached out 3 times with the same form email in response to the review offering to work with me.  Great!

Lowering from 2 stars to 1 star for lack of support.  I've sent 4 emails and not had a single reply. It will faithfully record every car passing by on the street. I have had 4 Amazon deliveries where the person stood on my porch less than 3 feet from the Ring doorbell, and none of them were recorded. It's a novelty item, you cannot depend on the technology to work when it's really needed. (Yes I'm using the ""wedge"" to point it downward, it's still unreliable) Look if you are thinking about buying, this review isn't going to matter.

"Not too bad for non professional, but battery sucks!!","Bought this for the front door of the house monitoring. Have been using it for almost a month now. I like it for the most part. Video quality is pretty good but you really have to play with all the settings to find the right detections and still sometimes it doesn't capture all the motions you really need. Sometimes it does not detect a person right in front of the camera or motion. Yet other times it will be so sensitive it will pick up leaves blowing on a tree or a squirrel walking by. The very worst part in my experience is the battery life. It drains super fast especially when you go on live view. I have to switch the battery out for the second time since first being installed. So basically the battery lasts about a week. Definitely invest in a backup battery because it take 6-8 hours to charge. So you waste a day for charging just to last 6-7 more days and do it all over again.. For not being a super high tech type of device, is it worth the price, no I think the price should be lowered due to all of the issues you still deal with. But overall I am not completely dissatisfied, I do like it otherwise and do not regret purchasing it.","18 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","amanda wilmoth","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9"

"This thing is AMAZING.","We recently bought a Ring 3, and it’s AMAZING. Setup was super easy- the app walks you through every single step. We wired ours in with the old doorbell wires, which was also really easy (the app gives step by step video instructions for that, too). The picture clarity is fantastic, and it was really easy to set the sensitivity and block out areas I wanted the motion detection to ignore, like the tree next to our walk-up. The cars passing by on our street don’t trigger the motion detection alerts, and we can pull in and out of the driveway without triggering the alert. That’s the way we want it- we only want alerts when there is motion on the porch- but it can be easily set to detect motion that far out if you want it to (the default settings were that way, and it worked perfectly). When someone rings the doorbell, it very quickly shows the live feed on our phones, and it’s easy to have a two-way conversation with the person at the door. The app setup also asked me if I wanted to make our old doorbell chime- the one in the house that’s been here for 40+ years- continue to chime as it always has when the Ring doorbell button is pushed. I said I did, the app was like “ok cool, give it a try!” I pushed the Ring doorbell, the old chime chimed (and the alerts popped up and chimed on our phones), and the app said, “did it work?” I said it did, and it said, “great, you’re all set!” (Note: we can use this function because we wired our Ring with the old doorbell wires.) That’s how good the setup instructions are. In a matter of hours we had it wired and mounted and working perfectly to detect the motion we want it to detect for our specific needs. There is essentially no lag time in the feed- maybe the tiniest fraction of a second, but certainly nothing that makes the two-way live talking feature a problem. I’ve had plenty of cell phone conversations with a longer lag than this. The whole system is exactly what we hoped it would be. When I bought the Ring 3 I noticed there was a drop down menu to choose just the Ring 3, or the Ring 3 with a free Echo Show. This seemed crazy to me- I could add an Echo Show and it was the same price as just the Ring 3?- but indeed, that’s exactly what happened! The Echo Show showed up a day before the Ring, which gave me some time to figure out what it can do. It’s far more useful than I imagined it would be, and it works seamlessly with the Ring 3. The second someone rings the doorbell, the live feed appears on the screen. We’ve only had our Ring for a few days, but it’s working flawlessly. We do have a really fast WiFi connection and the router isn’t far from the front door, so maybe that’s part of why it’s working so well for us.","07 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710luWMMRxL._SY88.jpg","Yes","M.F.","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9"

Installation was simple but the supplied screws interfered with the mounting so I had to replace them (a trip to the hardware store). I have an American flag on the porch.

It came in the kit with 2 different mounts 2. Wire extensions 3. Removable battery 4. Faster 5. Didn’t drop yet (knock on wood) I love the clarity and the ease of operation I set up the free account for 30 days, have my daughter and wife access to it...

"50/50 chance with this camera system","Pro: I can talk to the person that’s at my door. I’m able to tell ups/FedEx etc to leave packages at my door instead of their attempt delivery due to nobody being home. Easy install with directions. Nice camera view Con: the camera have a slow catching to motion like, the camera sometimes don’t start recording when people walk up to my door but when they ring the doorbell or make a lot of movement to set off the motion detector. The battery life suck if you always checking the camera. I had to buy a backup battery when the one install goes dead (bad reviews for the solar battery is why i didn’t buy that one). The camera blackout around 2:30am until like 4am. The camera is useless when it’s raining or froggy outside. Pictures are much better during the day Instead of night time. I wish there was a option to move the camera around through the app. 10/5/2020.

"Connection issues are tough to look passed...","I ordered this strictly to replace my Ring 2 because I wanted the rollback feature due to living in an apartment building. Like everyone says, depending on your situation, it may not be worth the upgrade. Only issues I have is the connection to my Ring 3 Plus is not anywhere near as good as my Ring 2. It performs much slower in the app, and sometimes doesn't queue a live feed at all... Also, almost every night between the hours of 2 am and 5 am, it says ""footage not available"" for some reason. If you have a Ring product, or thinking about it, I don't need to tell you why this is a big deal. Hopefully this will get fixed in a software update of some kind. Other than the above issues which are tough to look passed, the camera is a big step up. It's much clearer in day/night modes than the Ring 2,  and has a bit more of an aggressive ""fish eye"" display that I like.","05 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Tyler","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"Best product ever! Best customer support ever! Ignore all negative reviews!","To all the negative reviewers of this wonderful product, listen closely! the only reason you're having trouble is your Wi-Fi signal/positioning of your Wi-Fi modem! All you need to do is call Ring support... they answer in less than a minute, walk you through all your options and they recommend You buy the product from Amazon. So, originally I bought the 2nd generation, but I didn't like removing the whole unit to charge the internal battery. Amazon allowed me to return it and I purchased the 3rd generation +. With five interest-free payment this was the easiest thing I ever did! Now to the unit itself... when I first had trouble I called ring support they were able to diagnose my issues and my problem was Wi-Fi signal. I purchased the ring chime Pro Wi-Fi extender and that fixed the problem almost immediately, except when I added a stick-up cam to the system. The mistake I made was not contacting Xfinity in regards to my internet speed/strength of Wi-Fi signal. Turns out, my Wi-Fi modem was 5 years old and wouldn't take updates anymore! since I rent my modem they sent me their latest model. After another call to Ring support, I connected my outdoor stick up cam directly to my 2.4 gigahertz signal from the new Wi-Fi modem, then moved ring chime Pro Wi-Fi extender closer to the front door camera and Wallah! I have never had better reception, better motion detection and better signal! You naysayers need to be patient and go through the steps with Rng support - they're the best! And Amazon is for allowing me to return whenever I need to! Also, Amazon offering interest-free payments how can you beat that? I'm on a fixed income and it's exactly what I needed in my financial situation.

"It’s good, it could be much better","The pre-roll is one of the most important features because it records what happened before the act, but the video quality is so poor that it’s not really useful for helping for identifying much. I’m sure the reason for the poor quality is to consume battery life, but my Ring is hardwired to the electrical and battery life isn’t an issue. The videos are always stored in the cloud, and I’d like to see a local storage option that provides more options, including constant recording. The Ring is supposed to trigger the existing mechanical doorbell, but I find that it often doesn’t and I’m not sure what the issue could be. The Ring doorbell integrates well with Alexa very well, but as tends to be the case with app driven devices, they load slower than I’d like. For example, I could walk faster from the furthest part of my house to the front door at about the same time the Ring app loads after alerting me. That said, I find the app useful when music or movies are too loud and I can’t hear the bell ring.","16 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Ace","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"Overall a good unit, but the battery life...","Seems to be good quality and was easy to install and set up.  Finally got the motion settings so it wouldn't detect every single car that went by.  It has a setting to detect only between 5-15 ft, but that actually goes beyond that, so I had to play with the actual detection zones.  There is a decent delay between the time it detects motion to the time I'm notified.  The biggest thing is the battery life.  Doing the math, it's actually losing about 1.4% charge per day, and it's not detecting much at all, maybe just the mailman and UPS guy.  At this rate, it'll only have about 15% charge left in about 60 days (2 months), and that's a far cry from the 6-12 months that Ring tells you it will last (that's unacceptable).  Their tech support told me it's the wifi reception, but I tend to disagree because there's only about 30 ft between my router and the device.  I don't know what Ring bases the 6-12 months on.  Will I keep it ?  Not sure, I'll give it a chance.","24 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Chris","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"

"Expect network setup problems, when working it is good","I read the reviews and purchased this anyway.  I have wanted this product for sometime so I took a chance. I have a background in IT and work in IT.  I spend several hours trying to get this to connect to my Orbi network, which has 29 other devices connected to it, all working just fine. After about three hours I managed to get it connected so that Live view would show up.  After I installed it on my door frame, I lost the Live view even though the device reported it was online and the signal strength was excellent. This is but one part of the frustration and indicated how worthless a device self check is. I read the work arounds for connecting to Orbi but I am not going to alter my network to make one device work. When the Ring Chime was delivered, configured and installed, the doorbell started working.  I was going to buy the Chime anyway but I am puzzled about why this now works since they are all still on my Orbi network. If you intend to purchase both you may be fine but the doorbell itself could be a problem. Now that it has been working for a few days, it is a good product, the Live view still takes a long time to appear occasionally but it works.  The events, recordings and the logs are very nice.  I like the neighborhood notifications and I would like to add more products if they will stay properly connected.  If not, they will be returned immediately.","02 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","beshannonphotos","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"Great Investment","The delay is a little slow before the video is activated.  The nighttime video is OK but not great.  However, overall, I am really happy with this purchase and feel more secure.  I love seeing what else is going on in the neighborhood - porch thieves, people rummaging through unlocked cars, even one car theft, bobcats, and mountain lions wandering through people's yard at night (don't leave your small pets outside).  Once a week, I get a report of crimes reported to the Police. I did get an alarm of motion at my front door while I was away.  Unfortunately, I was in an area with poor reception with one cell, I could not view until I got into an area with better cell coverage. I've recommended to several friends. The installation was super simple and packed beautifully with everything you need, even the screwdriver.  I did put one screw in by hand but drilled the other three holes with an electric drill which was much easier on my hand.  I highly recommend.","05 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Lore","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=11"
"Kind of big","I really wanted to use the Ring Video Doorbell Pro but I found out the wiring to my old doorbell was not intact and I could not run new wires from the transformer to the outside in an easy, un-noticeable manner.  So, I did the next best thing and bought this model which has many of the same features but can be battery operated instead of hard-wired.  This device is larger due to the battery but when paired with the angle base (so the doorbell camera can get better videos) it winds up being quite a ""block"" on the side of my door frame.  The doorbell seems to work well but I haven't gotten the motion-sensing dialed in yet because it still reports street movement when large vehicles pass the house despite my tweaking the settings.","09 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Robert S.

"So far I am pleased!","Setup is pretty easy and intuitive. Preparation was a little harder for a hard wired operation. I ran number 18 transformer/ thermostat wire from  a 24 volt transformer to the doorbell site. The existing wire was too small and brittle. This device battery  will trickle charge from wired connections. I purchased two chimes as well, but the doorbell can use standard 24 volt chimes if they are hard  wired so I have both in service. The app has a lot of features and controls you can use to customize operation. Some quibbles and suggestions are : 1. The mounting block is universal ,not necessarily meant for siding with 4 inch reveal. I glued a small wood block to their mount to support and “locate” it at the bottom end. 2. The bubble level is basically useless If you use their mounting block, as you need to get the mounting block level and plumb. There is no adjustability to the doorbell itself in that case. It would have been helpful to have a horizontal slotting in the mounting block rather than  vertical. 3. Motion sensitivity can be adjusted auto or manually. I tried both. Ways but it does pick up some motion more than 30 feet away. My driveway is 60 feet long. My neighbors driveway across the street rises as does mine so the doorbell picks up their vehicles moving if they are near the top of their driveway. The same for large delivery trucks like UPS. You can’t limit distance but you can adjust sensitivity with a slider  so I am experimenting with that. 4. If going totally wireless, buy a seconded batter as the recharge time is over five hours.","26 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Robert","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=11"

"Answering The Doorbell On Your Phone Is An Awkward Process!","I purchased a Ring Video Doorbell 3 and a Chime Pro about two weeks ago. I had some problems with the installation and wound up returning my original devices to exchange for new ones. I finally got them installed and working properly. Initially, I was pleased with the operation of the doorbell and chime until someone pressed the doorbell button and I went crazy trying to figure out how to answer the doorbell with my phone. It is a very awkward procedure to answer the doorbell. I have to: 1. Unlock my phone, (and, sometimes my phone is in my pocket which is an extra step), 2. Start Ring app, 3. Activate and wait for Live View to start, and finally, 4. Turn on the speaker & microphone to talk to and listen to whoever is at the door. Ring needs to update its software so we can answer the doorbell as easily as we answer an incoming call on our phone. I don't recommend the Ring unless you really need the features it offers AND you are willing to jump through hoops to answer the doorbell!","18 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","WCHettel","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=11"

Because of new guidelines.  When tried to find out why which was completely unclear we just received a more unclear email simply stating it violated RINGS new guidelines.

"Needs at least 2Mbps  upload speed, minimum.","I was having trouble with my first Ring Doorbell 3. The audio on our unit was broken up and choppy. I spent a week trying ALL of the recommended solutions I could find, nothing worked. I then requested a replacement unit which arrived in one day. I do appreciate the great Amazon service. However the 2and unit was experiencing the same audio problem. I came to the conclusion that my in house internet speed was the problem. I had the service tech come out and tested our entire system. We discovered that our internet speed, which is supposed to be 25mbps download and 2mbps upload and is the highest speed that At&T offers, is actually 20.63mbps download and 1.63mbps upload. The recommended upload speed for the Ring Doorbell 3 is 2mbps. After trying the unit on my Phone's Hotspot which is way above these speeds it worked fine. Sadly we are unable to get any higher speed from our home service because we are 1 mile away from the main hook up box for our internet. So due to these circumstances we were unable to use this unit. I highly recommend you check your internet speeds prior to ordering this Ring Doorbell 3 unit.

"Love it! 2020","I read reviews EVERYWHERE and considered other products bc reviews are up and down.  But there’s a reason why everyone has the ring.  The ring doorbell 3 was so so easy to install.  I got it bc of the easy removable rechargeable battery bc I was planning not to wire install with existing chime.  However, after looking at the ring video tutorials on YouTube, it looked pretty easy and simple.  And guess what???  It was EASY and not scary at all!  Didn’t even need my husband’s help. I am so proud of myself! Installed it over stucco using the provided corner mount kit since my original chime is a bit far from my door.  But the video has a WIDE angle view so I can see everything even if the ring isn’t installed next to my door.  Additionally, I have two large brick columns on my porch that I was afraid would impact the view.  Nope.  Not a problem at all.  The wide angle is so good.  Video quality is good.  I set the video to only screen people so that I’m not getting a notification for every car that passes by. Note on existing chime: at first it didn’t work when I pressed on the ring button.  Thought oh great, will need husband to look at it.  Nope.  You just need to set it up on the Ring app under Device Settings, in-home chime settings, advanced settings.

"I was so surprised how bad this is","Even after reading so many negative reviews, I said it has to be pretty good since it's an Amazon product.  Nope! Here's my issues; 1.  No technical support or help line 2.  My live video hasn't worked since the first day 3.  Delays in the motion detection make it less useful 4.  After ringing the door bell, it causes it to vibrate 5.  Issues getting multiple devices to use it 6.  Motion detection does not tune well I had no trouble installing and getting my Ring 3 setup but that was the end of my good comments.  I feel with even some basic tech support (there is not email or number you can contact for support, which sucks!) I could overcome my some of my own issues with the Ring.  There is only a poorly put together ""Community"".

"Confusing at first.","Wow so you spend $200 on this product then they tell you to use all the features included with the product pay an extra $30 - $100 annually! Then we will allow you to use your $200 dollar camera -_- Update: 11/4/20 after being frustrated and leaving a bad review Amazon reached out to me. They informed me of a few ways to fix some of the bugs that I was experiencing. They also extended my trial. To receive all the features on the device. You still have to purchase a plan with them to use all the features on the device however the camera still behaves as a camera and you can live view it at any time. If you don't need a full-blown security system this is about the best way to go. I'm probably going to end up purchasing the plan for $30 a year! After all that's not too expensive but it is one of those things that would have been bold on the packaging that explains must have a purchase plan to use features! Based on their amazing customer service though I raised my one-star review to 5 stars!

"Decent video doorbell that you'll have to pay a monthly fee for","Functionally the doorbell works fine. It rings in your house (if you hook it up) and on your phone/smart devices. If you want to video with someone at the door, though, it's realistically too slow to do that. By the time you get the app opened and Ring connects to the door camera a normal person would be long gone. The motion detection is pretty hit or miss, too. You can fiddle with it for days and it'll still pick up things you don't want it to while seemingly ignoring human beings unless they're very close. Mine picks up cars fifty feet away but won't catch someone on my sidewalk. This is after working with all of the settings numerous times. The worst part, though, is that you're roped into paying for a subscription if you want the features that people actually use these cameras for - recording video triggered by motion or the doorbell. If you don't pay the monthly fee NO video is recorded. Which renders the Ring basically useless due to how slow it is to bring up a feed when motion/ring are detected.","02 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","B Grim","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=12"
"You get $150 worth. Do not expect more...","I was looking for solution for the front door and there are not many options unless you want to drill holes in your house and run cable. The setup of this product is easy and anybody can do it. You have to really drill down in the menus to find the functions to define your motion detection zones. My biggest beef with this product is that no matter what the setting is, the first 5-6 seconds are choppy, pixelated b/w video with no merit. I understand that an ultra-wide lens cannot produce forensic details edge to edge, but I am also strongly convinced, being from the industry, that a few bugs more invested in parts would move the needle significantly. Maybe Ring should consider a premium model for $50-70 more and get a better lens, a better sensor and more buffer on the camera.

I like the people only mode, this pretty much eliminate all the cars driving across my front yard. I would definitely recommend this over previous Ring. The extra 3 seconds of recording is a game changer.  I can see people coming and leaving. It is great at nighttime and the quality is good! Super clear.

Most of the time it doesn't pick up anyone at my door when they've left a package. I know people have been in or out and it shows no history. Im still in the 30 day trial for the most services  it offers but im not impressed at all. Idk if its the app or the ring 3 itself. But dang! If it changes ill change my rating.

"Poor WiFi sensitivity kills Rng 3+ usefulness.","A nice idea, but the WiFi sensitivity is poor. If I hold my iPhone X next to the Ring, I get 35 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. My Ring 3+ reports poor Internet and take over a minute to connect to the Ring app on my iPhone. Once it does the video is jerky and audio breaks up. The distance from my WAP (wireless access point) to the Ring 3+ is about 20’ through a glass and wood door. The reported RSSI is -71dB and evening moving the Ring 3+ next to the WAP only gets me to -63 dB. I plan to contact customer service, but it seems to me the antenna was either left off or is totally inadequate. If there was good WiFi sensitivity, this might be a very good device.","27 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","L.

"Happy with this!","I am happy with this purchase. You know what’s going on without having to physically monitor your front door. You get audio as well and can communicate too. For the most part it takes great video and you see well even at night without having to leave your lights on. Gone are the days I have to check on amazon to see if my package was delivered. You get instant notification with this when delivered to your door. You can also set sensitivity so it will either take just people at your front door or a larger area around your door. When I put it on sensitive it picks up cars, people, bikes around the area (which again you can set). When you get a notification it can take a few seconds to get live feed. I typically check after the video has been uploaded in history if it’s not urgent. It takes a minute or two to access recently recorded videos in your history. Which is why if I’m eager I click to view live to see what’s going on.","30 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","CC✨👩🏻‍🍳✨","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=13"
"Easy setup, expected better image quality & WiFi performance","Setup was very easy.  Out of the box, charge the battery (arrived with approx. 20% charge - got to 100% in about 4 hours) and install.  Download the Ring app and set up the device.  You can link your Ring to your Amazon account so that you get alerts from your Alexa devices, including visuals if you have a Show device. I'll say I expected a bit more quality.  Obviously not expecting 4K here, but it's far from 1080p picture quality (even with HDR enabled).  Also, I live in an apartment with a metal door - not a heavy thick door but is metal and not wood.  Although my WiFi reaches to the front door (my Fios gateway is less than 20 feet from my front door), once the door closed, the RSSI immediately dipped to -65 or worse, resulting in few to no alerts when motion was detected or when the bell was rung.  I subsequently had to buy a WiFi extender and install it at a mid-point to get the RSSI in to the 40s.  Since installing, I get prompt motion/doorbell alerts on all my devices (Alexas, phones, and my Apple Watch).  Not sure how ""enhanced"" the ""enhanced WiFi"" advertised is, but this ultimately ended up requiring a second purchase to boost the signal. I purchased this as part of the Ring/Echo Show 5 bundle Amazon had.  To get both devices for $150 is a great deal.  I would've been happier if the enhanced WiFi was enhanced enough to not require a boost and more money spent, but I'll let that go. Overall, I am satisfied with the device.  Easy (enough) installation and setup.  Would've liked somewhat better quality to identify people, and don't think the enhanced WiFi is all that enhanced.","15 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","mike","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=13"
"Great Product - Install could use some improvements","I love the product so far, but the install did not go well for brick. It would be much better had there been a paper drill bit template, possibly with a level, to make drilling the pilot holes easier. Also, the drill bit did very poorly on brick. It would have made much more sense to include both a wood and a masonry bit, or simply instruct the owner to buy a 7/32 masonry bit if you are installing on masonry. I included a picture of the bit I bought for about $5 and the condition of the bit that comes in the kit after 2.5 arduous holes. Sparks were flying from the Ring bit when I gave up on it. Also, mine is not quite level because the drill bit tends to drift on brick. The bit I bought cut through it like it was butter.  As I said, everything else seems great so far. I may go for more cameras after I've had this for awhile.","08 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71445qv97HL._SY88.jpg","Yes","H2O","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=13"

Installation as with the 2 was quick and easy-but the real news is the improvement in all parameters! It connects quickly and easily to my Apple devices; the picture and sound quality is excellent; and a few of the newer features such as a few seconds of video before the motion detectors sound off about a disturbance is neat. The real news for me though is the WiFi connectivity improvement!  The 2 would sometimes take 20 seconds to connect - not desirable for a front doorbell.  The 3 connects in a few seconds and as mentioned picture and sound are very good.

"HORRIBLE Install Support & App Malfunction","Three Problems with this product within first TWO WEEKS! 1) Horrible installation support:  The advertising for this device touts it's quick installation.  This might be the case IF it came with a proper manual, but it does not. Just as one example of a problem:  it comes with a hodge podge of screws of different lengths (3 long screws, 3 medium and 5 short screws) but there were no Security Screws for the Faceplate.  (Even though it was installers using the wrong screw to secure the faceplate that apparently triggered fires with the Ring Doorbell  When I called for installation support with a fairly simple question (precisely which screw might work as the ""security screw"") I was put on hold repeatedly for the agent to check.  At one point, she actually suggested I get on YouTube and just watch videos. She didn't direct me to the Ring website, she said ""YouTube"".  She was polite but her English was not great and she absolutely didn’t know the product. 2) App Malfunction the day before THANKSGIVING.  My Ring was hardwired, but then the app suddenly showed it as running on the battery with the battery at “0%”.  Hours later it showed as Hardwired again.  I called Ring support and their outgoing message stated that they were working on the problem.  So, the day before Thanksgiving, when a large proportion of people were traveling, the Ring app was malfunctioning on a wide scale.  WOW! 3) I just happened to identify one instance in which i walked out my front door - right past the Ring device - to check the mail and the Ring didn’t record that event.  But then it did record me walking back in the door.  I have no way of knowing how many other events the Ring may have missed because I don’t have time to keep testing it. At this point, I have no confidence in the device or app and hope that perhaps the sight of the device may discourage porch pirates and potential burglars. In other words, I now view my Ring device as a VERY EXPENSIVE PROP!","22 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518XmEhcgfL._SY88.jpg

"It is slow, slow, slow an you need to pay more","I receive a notification about a person being detected, when the person is already right at my door. However, it takes a few more long seconds before Alexa connects to the camera and show me who it is. I'm sure a legitimate guest would grow pretty impatient, and a bad guy may not get deterred enough at these delays. On my Mac, almost half of the time I see message ""connection to the camera took more than 10 seconds,"" and than I don't see anything happening at the door at all. The ring doorbell camera is mostly good to see what has already happened, not what is happening. If you were thinking not to pay for the subscription, think again. The camera is totally useless without a subscription. Did I mention it is slow? So, you only supposed to see live video. When it delayed so much, you don't see that much. However, slowness is not even the biggest problem if you do not have a subscription. By default, the camera produces motion alert for each car passing by. It is so annoying, that I've turned off alerting completely when my trial subscription expired. Then my ring doorbell was not much more useful than a plain old dumb doorbell. With a subscription, you get a new mode of motion detection. It will only alert when an actual person is detected. That removes the annoying car alerts, and only alert when it is useful. However, the person detection makes the detection even slower.","29 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Igor A.

"Frustrating piece of junk","Fluctuating delays in ringing and alerts defeats the whole purpose of this device. Most times, you get to see visitors only after they have left as pressing the button offers no alerts neither does the chime pro ring for extended periods of time.  I went to the Ring community and reaslied this is a common problem evidenced by the number of compalints i saw despite carrying out all the recommendations from the Ring team. Why can't they solve this problem? It's neither a WIFI problem nor a distance problem but a defect which needs to be  corrected. This is very frustrating.

"Has some flaws","While I like this product it has some flaws.  The largest one is the night vision.  It literally is crap on that feature.  I have read all the reviews on the support site of which a lot of people have this issue.  As much as you pay for this item, I would have hoped for a better night feature.  I have other security cams from a different vendor that work immaculately better than ring's. With that said, the daytime photo is perfect at 1080p.  I may have to get the solar option if the battery does not hold out.  In 4 days, I am down to 91% battery where there is no obstructions to set it off all the time and have adjusted the sentisivity.  The mounting brackets are great especially in a tight mounting situation.  I am happy that I got the $60 off deal as I would be even more upset if I paid full price for this.  These are great options if you don't have a wired doorbell to tap into for power.  I am glad however, that I didn't buy two.  The firmware is up to date so I hope they can somehow fix the night vision problem.","19 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","akita","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=14"
"Stops functioning within 2 weeks","I installed the Ring with expectations that it would be a great addition to my house. I expected to be able to get alerts when people were at my door, or see who was ringing the doorbell, etc. Well, within 2 weeks it started lagging and then stopped functioning after I contacted Ring Technical Support. Within 2 weeks the lag got so bad that a delivery person stood in front of the Ring, hit the button to ring the doorbell and finally had to knock on the door because the Ring was so delayed. I confirmed with Ring Technical Support that the wifi signal was strong. I had a neighbor come and get packages off of my porch while I was out of town. What did my Ring show? Packages there 1 minute, and gone the next. There was a total gap in the footage. I rang the bell, walked inside and 5 seconds later the bell went off. Hmmm...not a good doorbell. This is a waste of money and seems to be quite quirky. They obviously have not worked out all the bugs. I think I will return mine and get a traditional doorbell that will actually when the button is pushed.","04 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Michael Wood","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=14"

Before buying the device, they didnt mention ANYTHING about the subscription, and give you one month trial but after that, you need to pay a monthly fee in order to be able to watch the recorded videos. The motion detection is also not as good and sometimes it doesnt detect the motion at all. Also, because it’s battery powered, there is no way to turn on the blue light around the button to make it visible at night.

"Clearly Check the details on any purchase!","First off, I checked out several different models and different makers and I decided to go with the 3-plus. I liked the feature of pre-record. In looking into the ring, I was concerned with having to consider a service plan I elected to not go with the plan believing that I would still be able to see the videos for 7 days. I later found out that this is not correct and after the 30 days were up, I have no videos. The unit was fairly easy to install, although the trim around the door was not wide enough to mount the doorbell. I had to do some wood working to get it secure. I felt that I would go with a direct power line and use my original chimes. Unfortunately, this didn’t work due to the transformer was not suitable to ring the chimes. So I purchased the ring chimes and set it up (very simple) but the chime was so low and there was no way to make the sound louder. After all that, I returned the ring chime and went out to buy a transformer. I hooked up the new transformer and the original chimes work. My biggest issue is that in order to have the videos, I need to pay for the service plan. After spending appx $250,00, you still need to pay more for a plan which put this unit above the other brands price wise. I’m thinking hard that I’m considering to return  the unit. Frustrated and perplexed for sure.","31 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Amazon Customer","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=15"

The night visor is also fantastic for saying people, gives me a clear picture of the person standing at my door. Also looking at the mic and sound quality, extremely on point and can easily do a two way audio talk. Camera installation took only 5 to 10minutes, simple task with a couple of screws.

"Audio dropped after one week of little use","Had to return the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus since if failed after one week.  The issue is that the two way audio stopped working so you could not talk to or hear the person at the door. I worked with Ring support to determine this.  After some additional research there are many people complaining of the same issue. The whole reason I ordered the 3 plus was to replace the Pro.  What I liked about the pro is no battery required if hardwired. The only problem with the Pro is the button cracked after only two years.  Additional research also indicates others with this issue.","25 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Michael S","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=15"

"Nice try","When this works, it seems like it could offer a lot of peace of mind.  However, the Pre-roll video never really works.  The screen always says the ""video is still processing"" and we don't actually get to see it until 30+ minutes later.  The live video is hit or miss so far.  We've gotten the ""activating device"" circular indicator about 70% of the times we've had motion detected and tried to see who's at the door.  Had it been someone dangerous, Ring certainly wouldn't have helped the situation.  Luckily it's only been delivery people so far...Found that out about 30+ minutes after motion is detected.  So, all in all, not sure I trust this product to do what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it. Bummer.  That's a big price tag for a cute doorbell ringer. Update. See picture. Now our pre-roll trial expired...it’s the subscription to save your pre-roll video.  And since it expired the live video doesn’t work. The app continues to tell me to subscribe.  The message just keeps saying activating device and we can’t get it back.  It’s useless at this point. We still get the alerts but we can’t see anything. If you’re not willing to pay $30-100 per year, buy a different system.","15 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Pv6cStPsL._SY88.jpg","Yes","shophappy-2010","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=15"

The Ring door bell 2 was not as weather proof as the 3 but I need a functioning bell, not a wanna be.

"Mobile App com protocol can make the doorbell useless when wired charging does not work","I bought this because it has battery AND can be hardwired.  So it would keep the battery changed and work even when power was out. I really like the motion zone settings, sensitivity settings...the fact that you can change whether you want light, standard, or frequent motion detection events, that you can change the length of motion event recordings, and can tell it to take snapshots every N minutes to see things in the area progress throughout the day. But I don't like it when the mobile app will NOT allow me to access the device or provides erroneous information. Several weeks ago, I hardwired the device to doorbell AC wiring per the guidelines provided by Ring.  The device is hardwired, so it should be charging the battery all the time.  But it doesn't.  Or, at least it tells ME it isn't.  After several weeks of futzing with all the newly found online chatter of this known ""hardwire will not charge battery"" problem, I finally contacted Ring support. Ring Support was easy to get, and very helpful.  Less than 1 minutes once I was in the call queue.  But they are (so far) incapable of letting my Mobile App connect with my device reliably and use its features.  My app accurately says it is hardwired, but it tells me the device is offline with battery at 3%.  Ring Support says the device is online and charged over 90%.  My app won't even contact the Ring servers to attempt to LIVE VIEW the device camera because it thinks the device battery is too low.  The app doesn't even try!  The app assumes it knows the status of the device without actually going out to Ring servers to find out?!  I have verified with Ring Tech Support that my app is properly configured and registered with the correct Ring video doorbell device.  Yet, they can't get the data they have on their servers down to my device, and my device won't attempt to get the data from the servers. Ring Tech Support believes it sometimes just takes hours--up to 24 hours--for the mobile app to synch with the servers.  Well...that means I theoretically have a perfectly functioning video doorbell that I cannot use for hours at a time--sometimes an entire 24-hour day--thru the mobile app.  That is totally unacceptable.  And it proved to be inaccurate. Driving 300 miles round trip to the device I find that their information was not correct.  The device was not online.  It was not connected to wifi.  It had only 24% battery on it.  I had to reset/default to factory settings and go through the setup again to connect it to wifi.  And...the battery is not charging with a live 16vac on the terminals. I've upgraded my review from 1-star to 3-star as they are sending me a replacement Video Doorbell Pro with the defining feature that is not battery powered and requires to be wired.  I lose battery backup, but I clearly wasn't going to get that, anyway.  If the Video Doorbell Pro provides me all the features without issue, I will give that product the 5-stars it might deserve.","19 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Sirsas","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=15"

"The installation was very frustrating 👁👄👁","I’ve had the Ring 1 since the beginning. Decided to get the Ring 3 with Amazon days. A little surprising was the way it needed to be installed. They suggested putting a pencil through the holes to mark where you needed to drill. The pencil does not fit through the holes. Nor does a marker or sharpie. So there goes a half hour of my life. I made my own template of screw holes on paper and lined it up. Drilled the holes in the stucco and was ready to go. Charged the battery which took longer than previous battery... Slipped it in and tried to put the cover back on and nope. It wouldn’t snap on. Very frustrating. Like I just want to snap a cover on. This shouldn’t be that hard. The cover won’t fit. The product design is strange. I would never design a product like this as an engineer.

"New to RING Doorbell Camera.","Because our doorbell is at a right-angle to the entry door, I used both of the included offset mountings.  Installed using my cell-phone after loading the application.  The Ring doorbell includes a comprehensive kit with everything you need to install it.  There was also a coupon with the Ring for a custom color cover.  The color choices were horrible so I ordered the mustard color one and painted it to match the beige house, tedious to do but it looks really great. We get instant alerts if someone enters the Camera zone or rings the doorbell but our Show 5"" takes around 30 seconds for the image to appear.  This delay is frustrating, especially for the person waiting for us to answer the door.  The video is very good but is distorted due to the Fish-eye Camera lens.  During the day when we are working outside, we turn off the Ring alerts but we still get alerts.  Maybe we are doing something wrong?  We set an alert delay of 4 hours.  Any pointers would be welcome.  Another thing I noticed is the Lithium-Ion battery charging circuit isn't ideal.  Since it's wired to a doorbell circuit, the Ring gets charged up just fine.  What is odd is it charges to 100% and when gets down to 90%, it charges up to 100% again.  This is bad for Lithium-Ion batteries.  They love between a 30% and 90% charge for longevity.  EV owners know this.  Go into ""settings"" and then ""device health"" to view the battery status.  Wish they had a firmware update to optimize battery charging.  As it is, they can likely sell more $30 batteries. Overall, this is a good Doorbell Camera.  We already caught a delivery person pounding on our Home's cedar siding, like the Guy was having a tantrum.  Thought he was going to break his hand.  If we would have been home, we would have talked to him to see if he was OK, like mentally stable.  I guess everyone can have a bad day?  He had a Covid-19 facemask on so couldn't identify him but could tell he was NOT an Amazon driver.","16 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","1975re5","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=16"

"Faith restored?","This is one of those ""great when it works"" devices, sadly it almost never works. First off, my area had a couple of micro-power outages recently and ring needed to be completely reset each time. They sell you on the Doorbell 3 being battery powered, but don't warn you that the batteries hate the cold, meaning 1/3 of the US is going to have trouble for 1/3 of the year trying to use this. Had to reset the device again when temperatures dipped. Flat out replaced the battery after the first below freezing night, ring wouldn't connect. Reinstalled the battery, oops, that made it work. There are supposed to be several ways to access it except, depending upon the day, either my Android (phone) or Microsoft (PC) app doesn't work. Thought today was going to be good day when both (!) my Android and Windows apps chimed, except when I tried to activate the camera, a NEW error message - Gateway Timeout. I bought this because my Zoom room/home office is on the second floor of my house, but I've spent more time RE-installing, rebooting, rejiggering this thing - it is a waste of time. Of course, it is installed ON my house now so removing it (and throwing it out) is problematic in and of itself. UPDATE 12/02/20 - Ironically, after the Great Outage of 11/2020, my connection seems much more stable. Notifications via Android and Win10 apps are consistent. Not sure if they made some changes when things were down, but I am closer to enjoying the cool ""when it works"" status more regularly. Battery life may still be an issue, but knowing it relied on a battery, I already purchased a back so I just might have to swap out a bit more frequently than expected.","25 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Steve Hampe","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=16"

"Do not buy!","This is easily one of the worst purchases I have made.  It was recommended by an electrician and I’m sorry I listened to him.  It’s notable that Amazon asks to rate on motion detection, night vision and picture quality with no ability to give stars for battery life, ease of removing the battery, or delay between button press and chime sound. All I needed was a simple doorbell!  How much maintenance and coddling is a doorbell worth?  It should be minimal but this ridiculous thing demands as much attention as a newborn. I have had to turn the camera off because it triggered  the chime with every car that passed even when I shortened the range as much as possible.  When the camera was on I had to recharge the battery about every week and what a joke that is.  You have to remove a microscopic screw on the BOTTOM of the case.  Where is that screw likely to go if dropped?  Would you expect to ever see it again?  On top of that  recharging the battery takes at least 8 hours if not longer. To really close the decision on this disaster of a purchase the delay between pressing the doorbell and hearing the chime inside is at least 15 seconds.  A delivery man dropped a package at my front door ran back to his truck and was out of sight by the time the bell sounded.  There is no way to shorten that response time and online “help” was absolutely useless. I will probably leave the silly thing on the outside of my house just because of the aggravating hour (no kidding!) long process of trying to drill into my apparently petrified brick.  Now I’m looking for a battery free, analog cow bell to notify me when someone is at my door!","03 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","B. E.

"30-Day Review Update","Thought I'd post an update based on my Ring Doorbell 3 experience after 30-days of use.... I'd give perhaps 4 stars (of 5) for the actual Ring doorbell camera. That is, the picture/video quality is good. Unfortunately, the Ring software/app/user interface still rates 1 star (of 5). I'd give 0 stars if possible for the user interface(s).  Not just my opinion...now, my experience.  The user interface, either online PC or Android App, is REALLY VERY POOR. NOT user friendly and certainly NOT intuitive to use. Currently, I have need for other cameras/devices for our house. My computer/app skills are probably average to above average for a 60 y/o mechanical engineer. I will not purchase another Ring product and I certainly won't suggest or recommend Ring because the Ring doorbell 3+ is WAY to hard to use.","29 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","L Galey","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=16"
"The best product of my Thanksgiving Shopping.","Amazon has got the best products in the market. I have always lived in small apartments so I really didn’t think about the security cameras and video doorbells for our safety as everyone lived very close to each other in a cozy environment since years. We bought a house now and after searching for security products I came across amazon ring door bell. I bought Ring doorbell 3 as it has got almost all latest features. This is the only cheapest door bell which has got both hand wiring and battery charging feature. I bought this so that I can charge the battery with the charging wire provided in the kit and later handwire  it according to my convenience. It has got awesome clarity, night vision , sound clarity and good motion detection too . I connected it with my Eco show and feeling relieved . I no longer had to peep through the door to see whose there. Now iam  like “ Alexa, Show me the front door “!","02 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","shaaz","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=16"
"Good camera, lousy app!","Problem with the ring doorbell is the app. My phone is Android on Samsung S8+, OS updated to latest. This review is based on the app. The app is not useful and wrought with numerous issues, settings dont stick, menu items randomly disappear. Hard restarted phone several times,  flushed cache, finally uninstalled and reinstalled and problems persist. According to reviews in Android store for my phone model, almost all reviews are 1 star. Pretty big problem the manufacturer needs to address asap. I may be returning the ring doorbells all because of the app and not the cameras. Motion detection which is terrible may be phone app as well. I was getting alerts and suddenly all alerts simply stopped. I am so disappointed.","01 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","ParishLA","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=17"

Many of my neighbors are also excited and happy with this product.  Scary to see what happens on your porch etc at night.

I commend Ring on their customer service, Nicole could not have been more helpful and she followed up to see if our problems had been resolved. It takes so long to get the live feed whenever there is any type of motion or activity, it defeats the purpose of having the doorbell.

"Ring Doorbell and Run","My first venture into a video doorbell and I'm somewhat disappointed. Maybe it's because it's on battery and not hooked up to an existing doorbell but the  signal is shown to be weak on Ipad and since it's not full time video it's cumbersome to reconnect the view when someone comes to the door. Audio is weak and focus is not real tight looking into a brightly lit background. I've not been able to connect he Echo 5 Show that came with it even though I've gone through the setup multiple times. I'm sure Ring Products are good but, in my case,  I can't say it's user friendly.","06 May 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Linda Ash","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=17"
"Motion detection is 70/30","I wasn't expecting much from the Ring doorbell other than to be notified and be able to see who is at the door. Unfortunately even that was asking too much. Although there is no way to approach our door or front patio without being in the sensors view, it only triggers about 70% of the time. We had UPS place a package inside of storage table on the front patio, which we watched on the camera. When our son came home, he opened the table, took the package, unlocked the front door and came in and the Ring never saw anything? Many times I will walk out the front door or come in from the car and the sensor is never tripped. It's mounted on the left side of the door angled to the right, so there should be no way of not being seen. I would expect this from a $30 or $40 item, but not $180! Most likely going to return....","07 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Red Tail Photography","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=17"
"Don't bother trying to wire it to the doorbell system or to an external power source.","All ring products are not designed to receive enough power externally to charge the battery it even states in the package when you open it up that it cannot run without the battery relies on it to supplement power to the unit. If you try to connect it to an external power source for example the doorbell system / power adapter you will just be wasting your time and money you'd be better off just buying a second battery and charging one while the others in use. My reason for this is the makers of ring have designed it with the belief in mind that it will only record motion 5 times a day. At five triggers a day your battery will last 6 months without being hard-wired and if you do hard-wired it in it should never need changed. so before deciding to hardwire it to the doorbell or an external power source do the math at how many times you're going to actually trigger dayily...in my belief if you're going to have it go off more than 10 times a day you'd be better off just to buy a second battery and not waste your time trying to wire it up. Examples of how quickly you can rack up motion detection: A trip to and from work uses up 2 Mail delivery uses up 1 Kids going to and from school uses up 2 for every child. Your significant other going to work and coming home uses up 2 Going to walk that dog you there's another 8 uses a day. That's just the uses off the top of my head I really do love the ring I think it's a great product I'm enjoying it so far but don't waste your time trying to hardwire it. With external power supply I use 1% of the battery every 10 motion recordings without external power source I use 1% of battery every 9 motion recordings so the difference is nearly unnoticeable.","06 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ilchuQiKL._SY88.jpg","Yes","K&M","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=17"

"Wish I had gotten this sooner","When they say this is easy to install, it really is! I bought an Amcrest video doorbell so that I could integrate this to my zoneminder system and because it was cheaper. Short story, nothing worked and installation was much more involved than this. The ring doorbell is a simple replacement of your current doorbell. It doesn't require you to add an adapter to your chime box or anything. And, the app guides you through the installation in a breeze. Man, I wish I had bought ring doorbells years earlier. It's pretty cool how simple the app is, how quick (realtime) you get notifications and etc. My only gripe is that I wish there was a soft reboot button on the device. The instructions don't mention anything about it. Anyhow, if you needed to take out the battery to charge it and plug it back in, the ring device might not reconnect to your wifi. One way I found out how to 'soft reboot' the device was to: 1. Remove faceplate 2. Press the orange button on the top right and you'll hear ""setup mode"" 3. Wait a few seconds (maybe 10) and press the orange button again 4. Check the app and see if ""live view"" works again Despite the above issue, it's been treating me well so far. Hope that helps","14 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","LD","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=18"

"Disappointed","I waited a long time before I purchased a video doorbell.  I went with the RING because of the Ratings and Reviews and because it was one of the biggest names.  I got the RING VIDEO DOORBELL and ECHO SHOW bundle.  The installation was simple and easy.  But, I am very disappointed in the performance of the RING VIDEO DOORBELL.  It takes a LONG time for either my Android OR my ECHO SHOW to actually display the video.  I mean like 30-45 seconds.  Also, the ECHO SHOW connection is very intermittent and bad.  So, someone rings my doorbell.  It takes about 10-20 seconds for the alert to come on my ECHO or phone.  Then, it takes 30 - 45 seconds for me to actually connect with my Android phone (or if I am lucky, the ECHO SHOW).  By that time, they have rang the doorbell again, which seems to mess everything up.  Anyway.  I am very disappointed in the RING VIDEO DOORBELL.  Plus, they constantly want to up sell me.  It's frustrating.  Just to clarify, I have the latest and greatest WIFI router with a 1GB internet connection, so I know that is not the issue.  I wish it just worked efficiently, consistently and reliably.  But, that has not been my experience.","17 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","WkB","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=18"
"The best Ring doorbell is the 3 plus.","The Ring 3 Plus model is the only one that can connect to a 5Ghz WiFi network so it responds the fastest when you need to answer a ring. It also is the only model that has the preroll feature to record 4 seconds of video before motion is triggered. Honestly this is the only ring doorbell that makes sense. I originally had the first generation Ring doorbell and it was super slow to respond even with a strong 2.4Ghz WiFi access point just inside the front door. By the time the camera loaded the person who rang the doorbell already was gone. Another major issue with the original is that video didn’t record until it was too late. I would often see the back of a package delivery guys jacket at the start of each video. If someone stole a package off my porch I’d likely just see their back too. Or when someone destroyed my wife’s flowers and beautiful plants in the front yard our Ring 1st gen camera caught nothing. In one video the flowers are there. In the next they are gone and everything stomped on. The Ring 3 Plus is the only doorbell camera model you should be looking at if you care about the actual reasons you need a doorbell cam.","15 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=18"

"Give it a chance","There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews about the Ring system, but we gave it a shot anyway. Delivery was quick, installation was relatively easy, and picture/video quality is very clear. Where we ran into problems was that the battery was draining too quickly. We live right by the road and the camer picked up every single car as ""motion at the front door."" After a couple days, we ended up installing the wedge mount behind the doorbell so that the camera was aimed more towards our walkway than directly at the road. We also adjusted some sensitivity settings and within the next couple of days, the doorbell got its act together and stopped picking up on passing cars, and our battery stopped draining so quickly. We also bought a replacement battery, which is convenient so you can just switch in the new battery while the other battery charges. If you are having issues, I'd suggest talking to customer service. This product works great when all of the settings are where they're supposed to be.","18 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JpWGmvijL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Allison J.","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=18"

We now have a new door (no knocker) and, unfortunately, no dog.  :(  Very quickly we realized that we were missing knocks and packages would sit outside for hours or even all day.  With the ring, we always know when it's time to check the porch!  We also have other Amazon products with which this integrates very nicely like the Echo Show!  So easy!

Being able to monitor the house on demand when we are traveling is wonderful.  We paid $199, but a little over a week ago and now the price dropped to $139, yet Amazon (owner of Ring) refused to refund the difference. They would let me buy another one then then return one (exact same item!) which is a waste of time and money.  I'm a disabled senior on SSD and even processing a return is difficult, yet $60 is a lot of money in my situation yet no one seemed to care.

"Good, but the concept of the Smart Home only exists if you go all in with one ecosystem","So far I really like this doorbell with one exception. Installation was easy, as was setup.  Took longer to perform a firmware update than it did to get the device installed in front of my home. Connectivity seems to be good so far too.  Can't comment on the battery life yet, but I have all the settings turned to moderate so we'll see. Still trying to figure out how not to get chimed when I go to check my mail, but that's probably just some settings in the motion detection that need tweaking. The big negative is that I use Nest WiFi and Google Home as my primary wifi / hub and Ring absolutely refuses to play nice with it.  I get that they're competing products, but it's pretty ridiculous that these two ""smart"" devices are purposely dumbed down so as to not work with each other.  Truth of the matter is, this doesn't make me want to get either an Alexa speaker or a Nest doorbell.  It makes me leery of buying from either brand going forward. Hopefully they'll get this fixed.  But for now, if you primarily use Google Home, prepare to be disappointed.","18 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Rick G","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=18"
"Battery Mode Unacceptable","First of all, battery mode gives you primitive motion zone setting ability. Just a few course blocks of the filed of view available for on/off motion detecting. But the battery life appears to be terrible, with 8 feet to access point and very few motion events logged so far, the fully charged battery has depleted 28% in 2 weeks. This equals about a 7 week battery life instead of the 6 months to a year advertised. Ring support has been great, but another major flaw is you have to be at the device to troubleshoot and get into setup modes, as opposed to several other brands that allow remote device management. Good luck with your stick up cam mounted high on a tree or house gable.","21 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: with $10 Echo Show 5","","Yes","Blueskyca","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=19"

There are times where it records cars driving by, and times where it doesn't record the same motion The people sensor is off as well. I have had a few packages get delivered and I've only received a notification on some Overall, the app is easy to use, and I don't need it for 100% monitoring the neighborhood.

"A good addition to your security system.","This ring doorbell works very well.  It sits there 24/monitoring the area near the entrance to your house.  It detects motion and stores video.  It will send you alerts AND doorbell presses even when you are not at home.  It works day or night and it is powered by a battery that should give it at least a couple days use even in a power outtage.

The motion detection has taken a lot of tweaking and we still don't have it quite right. I think with some more time we'll get it just right. Setup was very easy and straightforward and it integrates well with all of my Alexa devices. One complaint I have is that this ships with 2 face plates - gray and black. This is a problem because we purchased a separate black face plate since it doesn't state anywhere on this product description that it comes with both.

"Needs weekly recharge","Bought a Ring Doorbell 3 to replace a 4 year old Ring Doorbell 1 with a battery that used to last at least a month. I noticed quick battery drain since the first day with the Doorbell 3. The first charge lasted 5 days with very few events recorded. Doorbell 3 does a good job at detecting persons during motion detection, useful for installations on busy streets. During the second charge, I disabled motion detection, hourly snapshots and live view, basically it was just activated by someone pushing the button. With just two doorbell events, battery still lasted less than a week. Tried contacting support and all they could suggest was to hardwire the unit or improve WiFi strength, which the Device Health reports as good. I was on hold for over an hour and was disconnected a few times, never got a call back after last disconnection. I bought Ring due to the option to operate only on battery, if I must deal with hardwiring, I’d consider other brands that integrate well with my other security products. I have no choice but return it.","08 Aug 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Eddie D","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=19"
"A better update than expected.","I’ve had the Ring Video Doorbell 2 for about 3 years. I live in an apartment and can’t position any kind of internet access closer than 3 stories above. This was always an issue. Yes the 2.4 signal reaches further but it’s much slower. I was able to make use of it by getting a beast of an extender. Anyway when I saw this version had the 5ghz range I was excited to see if it’d make much of a difference. I installed the doorbell, and first hooked it up to the 2.4ghz network the v2 was on. Very similar performance. Then although it wasn’t showing a great signal at all I connected to the 5ghz and boom, this thing is working like a charm. Super quick connection and pretty solid. I decided to spring for the “pro” model, because with the version 2 it often seemed like a recording started a little too late, especially with motion. The pre-roll feature is really cool and useful. Glad I went with it. The other big change was having the newer motion zone. I live in a building without any kind of space between the entrance and sidewalk, so the bell is right on the sidewalk. This made me not use the motion feature on the v2 because there’s constantly people walking by and the battery would die. I’ve noticed using the new motion zone as well as the person detection and turning the sensitivity down, that so far so good with the battery life and using motion on a well trafficked area.","10 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","J.

"doesn't work right.","At first it didn't work correctly.  It was routinely missing detecting  people on my front porch, which is half if it's purpose. Customer service was ""not available"" on their web site.  I tried all of the settings the best I could but to no avail.  In response to my review, I was contacted by customer service and they walked me through the setting that needed to be changed by phone.  Everything works now.  I like that it is able to be hardwired, using the battery as backup.  I have to say that most of the settings were intuitive, but a few were not, but once you get it figured out it is great.  For some reason, there is a bit less flexibility with the motion zones in comparison to version 1.  Version 1 was completely customizable whereas version 3 (this one) divided my porch into 4 zones that I can turn on and off.  This does not allow me to put a line between the yard and the street, and so it picks up a lot of cars.  I'm not sure if those same 4 zones are for everybody of if they were based on my porch in particular, as one of the borders aligns exactly with my support post.","28 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","c","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=19"
"Some drops in signal, overall great product","So we needed some home security but we didn’t want to break the bank. The good news , ring doorbell works 90-95% of the time , there are moments of dropped service. We have it on battery, and it this point it’s looking like we will get a month of battery use if not more before needing to re charge. That a plus , I was worried I would be charging this thing every week but it looks like once a month or maybe once very two months. Our doorbell is about 10 feet from our router but we still have very random drops in service. There will be random times it won’t catch us coming or going from the house, but again it’s sparse and random and not often enough to make me Feel like I am being cheated or sold a bad product. It works over wifi so honestly I would be more surprised if it never lost signal. Setup and installation was a breeze. The app and all the settings are easy to use. It does give us peace of mind being able to see the motion alerts  and being able to answer my door bell on the other side of the city via the app is a very cool feature. For the price I am not upset , and I am happy with my purchase, just know that if you are reading this and looking for the main drawback of such and affordable camera doorbell the drops in service is the big one.","06 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","c gavin","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=19"

A week after installing the doorbell it stopped working and will no longer show live view video feeds, the doorbell doesn't work and it doesn't detect motion. I tried following the steps provided by Ring to reset the doorbell and change it's internet connection, it didn't work at all. There is a little orange button that is supposed to put the doorbell in setup mode and it doesn't even work. The Ring Doorbell 3 Plus I purchased is just dead, it does nothing. The light around the doorbell button comes on! thats about it. This is a common problem with Ring doorbells I found after I searched online.

"Beyond extremely satisfied and impressed. No regrets with this purchase","I have to say I am super duper impressed at this product. I am a big time nerd-techy person and I have been eyeing the Ring for some time now. I do not have a hard wired doorbell and I was excited when I did my research and read the reviews watched videos and I finally made the purchase. The features are incredible from the quality of doorbell itself, the installation which was fairly easy about 15 min max, the set up (which only took less than 15 min) the only small issue I had was the WiFi connection on the app but very minimal time lost. The Ring app itself is also very impressive from the ease of navigation, set up assistance, interface and user friendly as all the options available. The video quality both daytime and night vision is spot on. It can look a tiny bit grainy when on night-vision depending on the weather which is a given but not by much. Everything was very well packaged and labeled and all tools were included. Again I am beyond impressed and I will be purchasing more Ring products. Many props to the makers of this product.","15 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=20"
"It works great","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Overall, the ring package was great. Tools included, short n long screws, etc. My vinyl siding was 4 inches. Too small to use the wedge included, so i had to buy another vinyl siding surface block fr Amazon,special order at my lowes. I couldn't install over my existing doorbell, as opening the door would block the ring camera. I managed to get it installed. Charge the battery before u do anything, it took 6 hours for mine. The app installed n connected to ring ok after I got everything in front of my wifi box, it wouldn't install from my wifi extender, why, I don't know. Update:I detached everything n then attached the corner kit that angles the camera with the longest screws that reach into the siding, so my entire sidewalk was in the camera range. After that bracket was screwed into the surface block n siding, I screwed the ring doorbell into the bracket using the smallest screws. Now my ring picks up my complete walkway. They give you all sizes of screws.","10 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C2-9o8itL._SY88.jpg

"Motion detection is terrible updated to good","I bought a whole bunch of devices and was really looking forward to this door bell. I even bought 2 but the motion detection is terrible.  I have to walk all the way up to it about 2 feet before motion is detected.  I was hoping at least 10 feet out.  My detection zone is set correct as well but I don’t know why it’s so terrible with detection.  Some times I can walk within 1 feet and motion is not detected.  I even set it to max sensitivity.  Very very disappointed.  Since it’s only day 1, I will play with it a little more but if things don’t improve I’m going to return for a replacement.  I thought motion is up to 30 feet?  My stick up camera has good motion distance.  Why isn’t the doorbell the same or better?  It costs more. Update: so after giving this some time it’s working pretty good.  I think I had an incorrect setting with snooze without knowing what it does.  Now detection and alert is working as expected.  For some reason though my front door bell is draining batteries faster than my back.  They are both door bell 3 and battery operated and set to same for all settings and traffic is pretty much the same.","14 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Naste","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=20"
"Lag, Person Detection, Better Night Vision are my hopes for the future","Night vision, motion detection and lag are the primary things which keep this product from getting 5 stars.  When there is someone at the door, or motion is detected, there is a good sized lag before you can see the video on your phone.  sometimes it is long enough to miss the guest and the opportunity to answer the doorbell call.  Night vision is just ok.  There are features I would like to see work better: the geofencing for the area of motion detection is too simple.  I was under the belief that you could create your own shape of geofence, but that feature isn't there yet.  I do receive too many detection alerts for passing traffic.  I have turned on the feature for Person Recognition but it still alerts on large trucks as artifacts.  I would suggest to RING that instead of having a Person Detection feature, why don't they try the opposite and have a Passing Vehicle Detection feature that ignores alerts.  I like that they include the wedges with the product now instead of having to buy them separately.","08 Jun 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Todd Ulicny","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=20"
"Set-Up Was A Breeze","First, I'll just say that I think this version of Ring is a little overpriced. However, I'll say that it is very convenient and easy to use. I wired it to my existing doorbell after removing the old bell from the wall. Unfortunately, there is a problem with my existing doorbell because once I wired and installed it, the app said it was running on batt power, meaning there was no power going through it from the house. I believe this is not a Ring issue. By downloading the app, and following the set-up instructions, I was able to do it completely in about an hour. I like the accurate motion sensor. I like the ""Modes,"" like ""Away,"" ""Home,"" etc. The video quality is good. Unfortunately, since it cannot be hooked up to my existing bell and chime, I needed to buy the Ring Chime (an additional $50!) but aside from that, I'm overall happy with this smart doorbell. I also like that it comes with everything needed for install including a drill bit for stucco, as well as two brackets for ideal positioning. Would recommend.","27 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h3MrwJOML._SY88.jpg","Yes","Alphanumeric","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=20"

I have a battery operated base model that works twice as good as this “Enhanced” model, with one exception, the image quality is better, not great just better, if.............you can get an image to come up before it times out!!! That really upset me when I hooked it up. Since this is supposed to be the faster, better image, better motion area selection, “Enhanced” model, I had high expectations but in real life use applications, it’s slower, picture quality is marginally better and in my personal opinion it not worth the the extra money.

"Great ONLY if it’s hard wired","This doorbell was great was great for a long time, then I started having strange issues. It was hard wired to an existing doorbell system but suddenly stopped ringing the hard wired doorbell. I couldn’t figure it out. Then I moved to a new house that doesn’t have a hard wired doorbell. I thought the battery should last for a few months, but I’ve been here for 2 weeks and the battery is down below 40%. Why is there no power cable for this doorbell like the one that Ring sells for the Ring Doorbell Pro? To hardwire this, I would need to pay an electrician to wire in a doorbell transformer. This is unacceptable.

(for a different property than nest) Battery lasted less than 2 weeks with minimal settings configured. Had issues with wifi, so I got a chime pro, that DID fix that issue. But I did end up having to hook up the doorbell to the existing wiring because 2 weeks of battery life is unacceptable.

"No security screws, dismal support for 2 homes","Seems like an OK product, but marred by a couple of issues that were really annoying. In my order of 2 ring 3 doorbells (1) neither ring came with security screws and (2) I am using these 2 at home & already have a Ring at our vacation home. It was almost impossible to work out how to view the new doorbells - instructions that came with the unit were useless, as was online help. Only my vacation home Ring was shown. My new Rings were nowhere to be found. Surely this must be a common scenario! The ""Locations"" & ""Address"" help topics on-line were worse than useless - actively misleading in this scenario. Only one address can be entered! Finally figured it out by trial & error (an inconspicuous dropdown arrow). Also, the app (latest version) encourages one to link to one's Amazon account. I tried, & it kept saying that the password was incorrect. NO it was not - I finally logged in to Amazon on a browser, entered the IDENTICAL password, and it was accepted.  Altogether an annoying, buggy, ill-thought-out, time-wasting experience. We'll see how well the cameras work in practice.

"Works like a champ and buy the 2nd battery when you get this","Since the pandemic our neighborhood has been getting increasing in crime. We got the 2nd generation alarm and after some work we finally got it online. Once we started to see the types of activity going on at night we got this.  We are in an apartment and there is no outdoor doorbell so this is perfect. I do recommend getting a 2nd battery at time of purchase! It's best to replace the dead battery with a charged one that way you don't forget to take the battery off the charger and have a ton of unrecorded time going by.","02 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Also I don't","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=21"
"It works and so does Ring support","I purchased three Ring 3 video doorbells, one for each entrance to our home. Two of them are hardwired to a 24 V doorvell circuit and the third operates on battery power. The installation was easy but I had to buy a separate pack of wedge kits because of my vinyl siding pitch. The setup took some getting used to but all three worked for about one week. That is when one of the doorbell powered units would not connect with my phone even though it was closer to my wifi router than the other two. A call to Ring Support let me talk to Fatima and she walked me through some checks, and got the device reconnected. I experienced the same thing on two more occasions but was able to get it working on my own. If it keeps happening I will push for a replacement but I am thoroughly satisfied with the Ring product and their customer support.","06 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","KC8RXQ","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=21"

I have the ring doorbell to and I have two front doors so I bought the doorbell 3 for the other door. I was going to install today and realize that they only provide one wedge when they used to provide three different types of wedges with your doorbell. For the price point being the same it’s very upsetting that they can’t even provide the same amount of wedges, and to make it worse the wedge I need is $20. Because I already did the installation on my app now my 30 day trial has begun but my doorbell is not installed because I am now waiting for the right wedge to deliver so I lose out on a week of free trial.","01 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Aloha NE","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=22"
"Keeps disconnecting from WiFi- FIXED!!! SEE UPDATE","PLEASE SEE MY 12/4/20 REVIEW UPDATE BELOW. Constantly disconnects from my WiFi. Rings answer is to reboot the router or move the router closer to the ring. I’d be rebooting the router constantly! And the ring is less than 20 feet from the router now. Nothing but trouble and problems. 12/4/20 UPDATE- Ring Customer Service reached out to me. They worked with me for an hour to analyze and determine the issue. Turns out part of the problem appears to be a “WiFi dead zone”. They assisted me in eliminating the dead zone. It’s been a few weeks now (I wasn’t available for a week). We’re currently testing to see if the correction will hold. Still have a minor issue, but that may be due to my settings. I am totally satisfied with the extent to which the CS personnel went to ensure this works!

"Pretty good","I'm overall happy with the Ring. It does the job: I can see who is at the door. The motion detection works about as well as I expected: despite pretty good options for tuning the response, we do get some false alarms. Be aware that to be really useful you have to buy a subscription to the service where they store the last 30 days of video in the cloud. WIthout that, by the time you respond to a motion alert whatever caused the alert is gone and you can't see what it was. Some other features are also only functional with the paid service.","26 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Steven Leffler","4.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=22"

"Device appears to be fairly good but tech support sucks. Maximum range is only about 15 feet.","Got the device installed it. The 30 ft or greater motion detection only works to about 15 feet. The tech support is terrible, you have to go through a robot phone tree then answer questions and then you get somebody in India that does not speak American English. That may be okay for people with perfect hearing but I have a very hard time with it. The pamphlet that comes with it is of no use for troubleshooting. The device does not have a delete all function so if you walk in and out of your house you're going to have to delete each one of those individually.

"Don't waste your money","Very pathetic for the price.  Hit or miss if it picks up motion.  Have been using now for a few weeks and have adjusted motion zone and sensitivity, but really random results.  I have tried setting it so that it would detect when the mailman delivers mail.  Mailbox is at the end of the driveway and Ring has not once detected mail being delivered.  However, when an early postal delivery vehicle drives by in the morning, it is detected.  Even didn't detect when the postal worker actually delivered a package that was left on the door step.  Other issue is that I have the Ring hardwired to existing door chime which helps keep the battery charged, but was also configured to ring the existing door chime, which worked at the time of setting up.  Now the chime no longer ""chimes"" when the doorbell is pushed.  Nothing has been reset, just quit working.

"Ring Doorbell with Battery","I purchased the Ring Doorbell with the battery several months back  expecting a pretty good product after reading all the reviews and hype. I decided to wait till I write a review to see how well this product works.  I am sad to say there is a lag in notifications when someone drops off a parcel.  I purchased the Ring Doorbell to help alleviate porch thieving in my area.  The other dissatisfaction I have is the battery is supposed to last like 6 months?  Are you kidding me?  It doesn't last close to 3 weeks!  I even purchased an extra battery and I am glad I did.  It's a pain to change every 3 weeks!  So if anyone of you are considering Ring with a battery, I'd suggest further research and get a hardwired device.  Totaly not happy with this.","11 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Catz","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=23"
"Not all of the Ring’s are perfect.","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Had the ring 2 and I loved it, but I didn’t like the lag when you pressed the screen to see the video. The 5ghz in the ring 3 is so much better, and the picture comes up way quicker so you won’t miss anything. I don’t notice anything else different. However, when I received my ring 3, there was a line in the screen. I’m thinking it is a camera defect. As you can tell from my screen recording, my phone is fine. It’s the camera itself. Customer support/Tech support was no help, and I had to jump through hoops to try and get this fix. Even hard reset the device, AND re-connected it to my phone from scratch, but still had the same issue. I got tired of wasting time talking to them, and did a exchange instead. When it’s clearly a hardware issue, they need to learn to just initiate the exchange for another one. Hopefully the next ring 3 will not have this defect.","05 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Fidel","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=23"
"It's nice compared to the 1st version","If I compare products, the first ring doorbell and this one, then I would definitely notice the difference,  and the video quality. I bought it with a special deal, I do think the battery durability needs more work, it doesn't last as long as the 1st ring doorbell, and if the price is going to be higher then the product should meet the expectations. I have the new ring set with the recommended settings,  I have tried multiple things to help the battery last longer, but it's not working, 4 days tops it's the longest we got. So I ended up buying another battery, because charging it also takes over 8 hours,  sometimes even more,  which makes no sense to me. Overall. The product is  fine,  it needs some work.  But the video quality is great.","13 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: with $10 Echo Show 5","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6154TX0hxkL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Marjorie","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=23"

"Don’t disconnect your old doorbell.","I gave up on Ring one because I had to reprogram it every time the power or Internet went out.  Ring2 waw a great improvement with a chargeable battery. That worked better , but I was still having to reprogram it by removing the battery, Taking off the faceplate, pushing a button, and doing several steps on my iPhone.  Even with the hard wiring, I had to manually recharge the battery often . A tech friend encouraged  me to buy ring3 because it would use both  2.4 and 5 signals.  No improvement. I have a deco mesh Wi-Fi system which works great. It takes too many steps and time to answer the doorbell,  even with rapid ring. And it frequently does not work at all.  I live in a city.

"Useless without the ring monthly service","With the monthly subscription service, this product is 5/5. Without the monthly service, this product is 1/5. I know the monthly service is not costly, however the doorbell loses virtually all functionality without it. You can not see any past video captures what-so-ever. For example, if you get a notification ""there is motion at your door"" and open the app immediately, you cannot see what event even triggered the alert. Without the Ring service the only thing you can do is live view. Before my Ring service expired, I was able to go into live view without any errors. Now that the ring service has expired, I have trouble every time. I get a reconnecting error and I have to refresh multiple times. Taking 30 or so seconds to access the live view. Whatever triggered the Ring is long gone.  I am certain this is a programmed feature so that it also makes it difficult to use even the live view without the monthly subscription service. DO NOT buy this product without knowing that you will HAVE to get the monthly subscription service.

"Falls a bit short of expectations","I’ve been using this for about a month now. Overall, it’s a fair product, but not great. Installation: Pretty smooth — I also hooked it in to the existing chime. Video quality: It’s okay, but not great. And night vision is completely non-existent. Audio quality: Decent, but a little choppy. Motion detection: The zones don’t actually work. I turned the zone “off” that covers the street, but my alert still goes off every time a car passes by. Service: Disappointing that there’s no SD slot for on-board video storage (for those of us who don’t want to pay another $10+/month subscription. Once the free trial expires, I’ll only be able to live-stream — no recording capability. Overall, it’s a fun tech gadget, but doesn’t quite meet the mark.","12 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Becky","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=24"

"Not A User Friendly App....and Wedge Is Awkward With Solar Charger","It's only been 24 hrs since my Ring 3 Plus has been installed and I'll give it more time but first impressions are quite negative. The motion detection chime was going off at least once a minute, perhaps from the wind. So I turned the motion sensitivity to low....and it still chimed every minute. So I turned off the motion alert...and it's still chiming every minute! So I turned off Ring Alerts....and it's still chiming every minute. Now I disabled motion detection and it's still ringing every minute. I have an Arlo security camera which can specify the exact areas for coverage. Ring has predetermined areas which can be turned on and off. But I have stairs in front of my house and if I choose the stairs only it's a very limited area of coverage. Being able to exactly specify areas of coverage would be nice. I bought a solar charger but I did not read any notice that it would not work well with a wedge. The wedge, included in the package to angle the camera down the stairs, and the solar charger are basically incompatible. I had to disconnect the Ring Chime Pro because it was a loud sound chime every minute within the house. Now my chime alert is only on the Ring outside the house but still obvious to everyone inside. The Ring App for Macs at the Apple Store has only a 2 star review (out of 5). I would have expected that the high priced Ring would have a higher user rating.","30 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Marty","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=24"
"Beware: subscription required","I tried a cheaper video doorbell and had nothing but problems. It would not stay connected to my WiFi, whenever I experienced a power outage it would require a hard reset and it would monitor the entire camera space instead of just my doorstep (it would alert me every time a car passed). The Ring video doorbell fixed all those issues. Update: the Ring doorbell will disconnect from WiFi and there is not a message or alarm to alert you when it does. Additionally my old video doorbell accepted a storage card, Ring does not. It's already priced at the top of the market and it requires an additional monthly subscription to be able to record.

Tried troubleshoot by pressing orange button and/or re-insert battery, nothing working. Checking with Ring customer services, hardware defective (USED ONLY A MONTH!!) Due to above problem, I requested replacement. However I got the small box which is not the same one I got when I first order. As you can see in the picture, my first order and replacement box are different. Due to that, I requested second replacement. However, I got the same one as first replacement.. VERY UPSET ON THIS.

"It dosen't work most of the time :(","When it works it is great. Trouble is, it doesn't work most of the time. We are in a very small house, Ring is near the wi-fi. It chimes when it wants to, rarely chimes when it is supposed to. We added a wi-fi boster thinking that would help, nope. Problems include but aren't limited to; in any setting, home, away, disarmed it 'ghost alerts'. On the other hand, often in any of those settings it won't alert nor will the doorbell ring when pushed. You can push the doorbell in any of the settings and it may or may not load to the phone. When testing you can hit doorbell and often, when it rings it takes forever to open the ap to see what is going on. There are still too many glitches to have this on the market. If someone knows the answer or has advice please share.

"Not Going Great So Far - Disappointed By Support","I got the Ring 3. Initially I liked it, everything seemed to be going great. Problems started a month in, when I needed to remove and charge the battery for the first time. The  battery wouldn't charge at all, no matter what I tried,  so I contacted Ring for a replacement part. They agreed it was an issue, and ordered a new battery to be sent. It's been 3 weeks and several calls to support and no battery in sight. I bought this camera because my house was broken into and I wanted to put some cameras around, and now I'm almost a month without security and Ring doesn't seem to care or take it seriously. I'm really surprised that it wasn't overnighted in the first place, and now that it's several weeks delayed, I'm in disbelief. They need to do better, especially for a first-time customer. I'm seriously thinking of returning it and buying a doorbell camera from a brand with better support, if this is what I can expect from them.","30 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Jess","2.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=25"

"Does not work at least half of the time.","Horrible. I have had problems from the beginning with it staying connected to my wifi. Live view only works, at most, about half the time.  Motion detection, maybe about 2/3 of the time. I have done everything possible to make sure that it isn't a problem with my router/internet connection, including buying a new router.  No other device in the house has these problems, except for the Chime Pro that I also have, and the doorbell is the closest device to the router (about 10 feet).  The Chime Pro, about 20 feet from it.  The chime also loses its connection on a regular basis, and usually reconects after unplugging & plugging back in.  Sometimes, the doorbell is fine for a while after removing the battery, then putting it back in, but eventually goes back to having problems within a day or two. I recently purchased & set up a Ring stick up camera, and that one has had no problems, and is the farthest device in the house from the router.","05 Dec 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","P.

"Not compatible with my doorbell, sluggish on motion detection","I really had high hopes for the Ring Doorbell. I've wanted to get one for years, and I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase one. If you're planning to get one, my bit of advice is to check to make sure your doorbell is actually compatible with it first. Seriously. Find your doorbell if you have a nice one, check the transformer on it, and see what kind of power it lists in the Output section. If you have a normal Ding-Dong doorbell, check your transformer and check the output for that. After I received the Ring Doorbell 3, I had help hooking it up. We used the existing doorbell wires, but the Ring wouldn't acknowledge that it received electricity (where it should have displayed ""Hardwired"" on the Device Health in the app, it simply shows ""Battery."" It also wouldn't ring through to my existing doorbell chime that came with the house that I built 4 year ago (for anyone who is interested, my doorbell is # 18888 (Input: 120VAC 60Hz. Output: 12VDC 6ms). After some research, I found that it's because the power that comes off of the doorbell chime box is not compatible with the Ring 3; it lets off the wrong kind of power (DC instead of AC). So, if I want to actually hear the doorbell ring, I will need to either spend more money and have an electrician come out and put in a new transformer and doorbell, or I will need to spend more money and get a Ring Chime. Either way, having to spend more money bites. Next up, sometimes when someone rings the doorbell, it doesn't ring through and they end up having to knock. This hasn't happened nearly as much as the next problem I'm listing below. The motion detection isn't all that great. Someone could have been at my door, and I've already let them in, and we're already talking for a few minutes before I get notified that there was motion when they arrived minutes ago. I've checked my internet and everything is running fine, so I don't see that as being the issue. Overall, unfortunately, I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. I miss my normal doorbell, but I don't want a bunch of holes on the front of my house, if I were to remove the Ring.","17 Nov 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Krissy","1.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=26"
"Surpassed my expectations","Pros 1. Easy installation -  I needed to install in a corner position. The side that the wire was coming out of was too small. Used the corner wedge.  Full view was obtained. 2. Works with Alexa skill 3. Motion detector great - I was able to setup routine to turn on my smart Porch lights at night and light in house. 4. My wife is hard of hearing - setup to chime the all Alexa dots and urn on light 5. Video recording is great and reasonable Cons 1. Nigh vision is not so good but since it turns on my porch lights it is an non-issue for me","01 Sep 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+63+g5n8L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Joseph Contegiacomo","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=27"
"Just okay","I purchased this because I did not have a doorbell and liked the idea of keeping an eye on my front door. The sensitivity is pretty unreliable. Sometimes my flag waving or a bug on the doorbell will trigger the motion and then several times (including today) I returned home and entered my house with no motion detected at all! Overall, I think it’s okay for the price point. Was considering the flood lights with camera but now that I have the doorbell and am not impressed, I won’t bother spending more money on this brand.","23 Jul 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Dana H","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=27"

Now for the last couple of days, whenever it detects motion, i cannot go and watch the camera. It keeps trying to establish connection.

Just found out I won't be receiving my Ring until the following Tuesday. Funny, when they want your money, they can ship it to your house in a day or two, but when my family is in need because we are without surveillance because of their faulty product, we're treated second rate.

I have two echo shows in the house so when the doorbell rings it announces it on the shows and a video pops up.  You do have to buy the chime if you don’t have an echo show or else you won’t hear the doorbell sound through the house.

"The Ring3 device works perfectly","Installation is easy. Works as expected.  The motion setting can be turned to only notify you when there is motion in the areas you care about. The hardware is good. The service... Do _*NOT*_ make the mistake of turning on the ""Nearby Incidents"" notifications.  Unless you want your phone alerting multiple times a day. That is why I gave the product a 3 in this review it's a complete package.  Even on the highest setting of ""Safety"" I get multiple alerts a day about bullsh*t.  An example?  I live in Arizona there are coyotes. This is not a safety concern.

"Excellent Doorbell Camera","Based on reviews I was a little worried the doorbell would not meet my expectations. Thankfully that has not been the case. I’ve had it for a little over a week now and it’s been great. Setup was a breeze. I was up and running within 20 mins Video and picture quality is excellent when HDR is enabled in the app settings Motion and notifications -  I have a palm tree that is in view and it has not triggered any false notifications when the foliage is flapping in the wind. When I tested motion by opening the front gate or entering/exiting the front door an alert is triggered every time. The intercom is solid. There is no lag or audio issues. Voice clarity is really good. It’s pretty much like using my iPhone on speaker Battery Life - This was my main concern but so far it’s holding up exceptionally well. After a little over a week my battery is at 95% The  Ring app has a clean UI and it’s very easy to use.

Box contains all the tools that are needed to install it. picture quality is great. impressive! couple of features i didn't like so far(that's why i gave it a 4 star): 1. Manual Chime should have been the default. i had to google it to fix it through the App to chime my pre-installed home chime. initially thought it could be voltage issue but eventually figured out that wasn't the case. 2. Ring tone of the outer device is fixed (default one). it would be excellent if we have the option to change the outer ring tone. so far so good.","19 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MTDrrWmXL._SY88.jpg

The ring door bell worked perfectly until the free trial ended of the recordings. Since i haven't enrolled in the monthly subscription every time there is motion movement it takes forever to load to LIVE. i really don't think its fair that only during the free trial it was working properly. the video quality is good but the motion sensor is a bit delayed by the time i open the app the person is already walking away. i kind of wished i would have purchased the Nest Hello door bell instead. will see how long this lasts me and it looks like ill have to subscribe to the monthly plan for it to properly work. and believe me i  have good WIFI. i guess the only good thing about this purchased is that it was a bundle deal.","02 Oct 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: with $10 Echo Show 5","","Yes","Ana","5.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=32"

It does nothing at night. 2. It should be sending power to the ringer in the house but that appears to not work, when I tested with a multimeter. 3. The UPS man probably has to walk 20 feet, at least, to my door. Often we see the back of him, if we get any picture, so, that is useless.

"Want it to go live like my other cameras","Very difficult to hook to live Have even put a Wi-Fi booster on it 10 ft from it obviously in the house My driveway and inside camera go live by just touching them I wonder if I just have a bad one It may take 3 times to get it to go live Ok Let me update my first comment that Amazon had requested from me. Well let me see  where do I start. I watched a lot of Ring Commercials after losing my existing wired alarm system. I ordered most of my Ring devices from Amazon and if you didn't know they own Ring. Now i'm kinda annal so I ordered everything that could apply to the system. All the extenders and chime pro devices. Anything that would make it work like the commercials. Even the Amazon Echo 8 which will show me and allow me to see and talk to who's at the door or driveway. The doorbell 3 was not out yet when I bought my system, that was about March. I was excited when I received my battery operated doorbell 3. I installed it and was immediately disappointed in a device that I had waited on,  and it didn't operate like it shows on the commercials. Because of the response above Ring support called me and told me that they wanted to resolve my issue. I found that I was talking to one of the senior support personal. He ask me if I would be willing to work with them and be a beta test for their product. I bought the system sometime in March and now its November. So we talked about every week and they worked on it for several months with the doorbell being below par. He always said I will turn it over to my tech department. My response became maybe you need to replace them because they don't seem to fix my problem. He always blamed it on my Spectrum internet which is at 400 speed. Another issue that I have is I have a 4000 sq ft house. That was part of the discussion. I don't remember in the commercials where it said this system is mainly or only for small apartments. After blaming Spectrum so much and not getting a better response. They suggested that we put in a Eero Wi-Fi extender. If you look it up it does more than just extend the Wi-Fi, it actually multiply's it. Well Amazon owns and sells this product also. At this point I can say that my whole system in on the Eero so all the extenders that I ordered are now in a drawer and not being used. The Eero is covering my whole house and I have 5 cameras and a Alexa Echo 8 and 2 Ring Pro that ring when the doorbell is activated. It is now performing well let's say 90 to 99%. If I try to get a live view of my doorbell 3 it usually opens most of the time the first time. I will say that in the morning it usually takes 5 to 8 times to open to a live view. Too be honest that is the hardest time for me to get a live view. I can say that if someone walks up to the door or by a motion detector it will open by touching the banner that is put on my phone. That is what Ring support is still working on. Although it's 95% better, it's not perfect but close to it. I also have a retrofit kit hooked to my existing wired alarm system in my house and it works great. I have to say that Ring support has been very diligent  in trying to resolve my issue, and have made a major improvement in it. The biggest improvement was the addition of the Eero system. At this point I'm  glad that I went with the Ring system and I'm very satisfied with The Ring support Team.","24 Apr 2020","Style: Ring Video Doorbell 3 Configuration: Doorbell only","","Yes","Rick Foster","3.0","Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus – enhanced wifi, improved motion detection, 4-second video previews, easy installation","https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3-Plus/product-reviews/B07WLP395R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=32"

"RING 3 Plus AUDIO Does NOT work after 2 seconds PROBLEM NOT fixed, NO SOLUTION available","Beware, AUDIO will NOT work after two seconds of 'recording' or 2 seconds of ""Go LIVE"", video will work fine and video will record and function as it should, but AUDIO cuts off after two seconds. Also, when someone rings the doorbell they CAN hear you for an entire conversation, but you CANNOT hear them after 2 seconds. This is noticeable AFTER the ring device is installed for 24-48 hours. The ONLY way to get it to work again is to remove and re-insert the battery. It will then work fine for about 24-72 hours then will do the same thing again. RING cust service will try to tell you it is your WIFI connection, but that is NOT true. I ran a test with mine placing the doorbell 3 feet away from router, and it does the same thing. This issue is NOT your WIFI, it is NOT your smart phone, but a software issue with RING 3 PLUS. RING software developers need to fix the issue as some internal code is telling the device to shut off AUDIO recording after two seconds. There a REDDIT article that discusses this very problem.

"One star! Better cameras available.","I wanted to wait after the first 30 days to write a review. The motion detection settings took plenty of adjusting until I could finally get it where a gust of wind shaking the leaves on my tree wouldn’t set it off. But now it won’t start until someone is already at the front door or practically walking away by the time it started capturing. The video quality is decent but nothing to rave about. The fact that I have to subscribe to be able to store images in the cloud is not so bad. But as soon as my trial ended it won’t let me connect to the camera. When I get the notification there’s motion detected I’m hit with a streaming error every single time. It did not have any issues before the trial ended!!! This problem seems purposeful and making the ring utterly useless without having a subscription. Would not recommend this product. Plenty of better alternative devices on the market.

Yet we get notifications every 5 minutes for motion detection. So what is going on? We’ve adjusted the settings multiple times to try and ensure we see what we need to in order to protect our home, but unfortunately it only seems to pick up the mailman and cars driving by our house. What a waste of $200+, I should have gotten Simplisafe. The ring doesn’t make me feel safer, in fact it puts my guard down because I thought we could trust is, and I have now been a victim to 2 different crimes thanks to its “help”.

If you like Amazon spying on your every move - and alerting you endlessly to pseudo “threats” in your neighborhood, by all means, this is THE device to feed your paranoia and xenophobia.

The last step is to install a security screw which is designed to deter theft of the device.  Neither unit came with them.  I contacted Ring who said I needed to go through Amazon.  Amazon said all they could do was to offer a replacement (already installed, doesn't make sense) or a partial refund.  All I want are the screws.  Back to Ring who only offers the purchase of a spare parts kit.  So for an extra $6 (with tax and shipping) I will eventually get the screws.

It’s just not worth the money. Not to mention that it arrived with mount hardware missing and there is no way to contact anyone to fix the problem.

Ultimately our doorbell proved to be defective and was replaced at no cost to us. The new one is working much better. After a week we have lost 10% of the battery charge. We can live with this. At this rate we can go 2 or 3 months before changing out the battery.
